  body: "From: http://answers.ros.org/question/50276/python-simpleactionserver-stops-unexpectedly-deadlock/\r\n\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to get the python debugger to produce the stack traces that explained the problem. But after looking at the roslog debug messages and the source code, I came up with the following reconstruction of the events:\r\n\r\nThread A (rospy's message dispatcher?)\r\n\r\nDeadlocked in: self.execute_condition.acquire()\r\nIn function: SimpleActionServer.internal_goal_callback() [simple_action_server.py:211] which was called from: ActionServer.internal_goal_callback() [action_server.py:293]\r\nThis thread has ActionServer.lock and wants to acquire SimpleActionServer.lock (condition variable was initialised with the latter lock).\r\nThread B (SimpleActionServer's executeLoop thread)\r\n\r\nDeadlocked in: with self.action_server.lock\r\nIn function ServerGoalHandle.set_accepted() [server_goal_handle.py:71] which was called from: SimpleActionServer.accept_new_goal()[simple_action_server.py:131] which was called from: SimpleActionServer.executeLoop()[simple_action_server.py:284] which at that point is holding SimpleActionServer.lock\r\nThis thread wants ActionServer.lock and has SimpleActionServer.lock\r\nIn summary, if if a new goal arrives at the same time executeLoop is trying to get a previous (but still new, SimpleActionServer will deadlock.\r\n\r\nI suspect the solution involves calling accept_new_goal() [simple_action_server.py:284] without holding SimpleActionServer.lock. My intuition is that simply setting a flag will do, but I will have to study the code a bit more to make sure there no side-effects.\r\n"

      body: "@dirk-thomas  see https://github.com/miguelsdc/deadlockTest repository. It has a complete ROS project (rosbuild, haven't yet got the hang of catkin) which will make actionlib deadlock.\r\n\r\nI know the code seems too demanding on actionlib and not representative of a real workload (eg. high frequency of requests, remote task is not really useful). As it turns out, getting one thread to accept an already-exisiting goal at the same time as the other thread is processing a newly arrived goal doesn't happen easily. The code in the repo can do deadlock reliably (particularly with the brutal launch file). Moreover, for some reason, using naoqi+nao_controller.py, also triggers the deadlock (which is how I originally cam across this issue).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, deadlockTest also deadlocks even after the proposed patch #5 is applied. There are 3 possible reasons: 1) deadlockTest is badly coded, 2) the patch is badly coded, 3) there's another potential deadlock in simple_action_server.py.\r\n\r\nI will investigate further tomorrow...\r\n"

      body: "Okay I've been re-reading the source code of simple_action_server.py and I still think there's no need to lock that area in `executeLoop()`. Let me explain why. \r\n\r\nThere are two functions that can potentially cause race conditions: `self.is_active()` and `self.is_new_goal_available()`.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first one: in polling implementations there's no problem because `executeLoop()` is never called. In callback implementations I'm assuming all `self.set_aborted/preempted/succeeded()` should be called by `self.execute_callback(goal)`. If the user forgets to set the status, then the goal is set to aborted (and the user is warned). I've searched through the code and found no instance of any other functions setting the state of the current goal.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the only calls to change the outcome of `set_active()` are made by the `executeLoop()` thread. So no race conditions on the first one, unless I'm missing something?.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for `self.is_new_goal_available()` there could be a serious error if `self.new_goal` was set to False between `executeLoop()`'s `self.is_new_goal_available()` and `self.accept_new_goal()`. However a quick search of the source code reveals that `self.new_goal` is only set to False by `self.accept_new_goal()`. Ergo, no race conditions :)\r\n\r\n*Nevertheless* just needing that much text to explain that code is okay (assuming I haven't missed anything) is clearly far from ideal, and could cause trouble should some of the assumptions stop being valid in the future.\r\n\r\nI see three options going forward:\r\n 1. Update comment to contain a summarised version of what I said above and warn about implicit assumptions so that new race conditions do not appear down the road.\r\n 2. Simply lock the critical piece of code with a `with self.action_server.lock, self.lock:` statement and leave it as it was before (I originally had it like this, but I was concerned it may be too long a time locked for action_server.py)\r\n 3. Do completely away with `self.lock` and just use `self.action_server.lock` instead.\r\n\r\nI reckon we should only take option 1. if you don't find any issues with the patch as it is now.\r\n\r\nOption 2. is the easiest to implement and to be honest I don't think the performance penalty is going to be that significant.\r\n\r\nOption 3. may seem stupid, but as the code stands whenever you have `self.lock` you end up having `self.action_server.lock` too (the only case where this is not explicit is on `internal_goal_callback()` and `internal_preempt_callback()` but I'm pretty sure those functions are called from within critical sections of action_server.py anyway). Option 3 has the advantage that deadlocks are no longer possible and makes the code more readable.\r\n\r\nWhich one should we go for? Or do you have any other ideas?"

        It would be very valuable to have your deadlock test as an actual unit
        test in actionlib. Could you convert it into a unittest using GTest to
        ensure that this will not break again in the future?

      body: "The updated pull request looks great! Indeed, the comments are more useful and the code in `executeLoop()` is clearer.\r\n\r\nI think it may be a good idea to cherry pick the patch in the fuerte, groovy and hydro branches. (All distros currently share the same simple_action_server.py file after all). Even more so since fuerte's EOL is fast approaching. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI'll convert deadlock test into an actual unit test (but using python's unittest if that's okay) as create a new pull request for it shortly."

        Thx. The code is still fucked Python-wise. I wanted to do a proper
        revert but @eacousineau did not answer in time. I'll update the Python
        side of the package as soon as I get an answer on

        @skohlbr  , you should have filed a new bug report for that. Thx for
        reporting. For now, just install the ros-hydro-urdfdom-py package.
        Otherwise, I fixed your problem in

        Ok, opened a new ticket (#20). I figured this to be a dependency issue
        so initially updated this one.

  body: "The pid_tests target has been broken for a while now, and it fails with the following message:\r\n```\r\ncontrol_toolbox/test/pid_tests.cpp:170:33: error: passing ‘const control_toolbox::Pid’ as ‘this’ argument of ‘control_toolbox::Pid::Gains control_toolbox::Pid::getGains()’ discards qualifiers [-fpermissive]\r\n```\r\nThe offending code is:\r\n```\r\nconst Pid pid4(pid3);\r\nPid::Gains g3 = pid4.getGains();\r\n```\r\nIt's calling the non-const method `getGains()` of the const object `pid4`. \r\n\r\nDoes it actually make sense to have a const `Pid` instance?. It would seem that you can't do much with it anyway. If there is indeed need for accessing the gains from a const instance, an API addition would be required. I tested this and it works (tests pass), but is pretty ugly:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst Pid::Gains& Pid::getGains() const\r\n{\r\n  return *(const_cast<realtime_tools::RealtimeBuffer<Gains>& >(gains_buffer_).readFromRT());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDidn't take the time to see if a cleaner implementation is possible. Still, I'd avoid it if there is no real need.\r\n\r\n@davetcoleman could you take a look at it?. You wrote that part of the test and worked on the pid implementation back in July."

        Well no one has missed it except this test, so I vote we not
        re-introduce it and instead just remove that test (which it has already
        been commented out). I don't see a need for that functionality at this
        point anyway.

  body: "The update in #220 will expose an issue with the include order: initializers for sub planning problems need to be included after the PlanningProblem header. If they are in the same block of includes they will be automatically reordered alphabetically causing this for any problem with a name starting with an alphabetical order less than PlanningProblem.\r\n\r\nThe current workaround is to add the initializer includes in a separate include block."

        Which FCL is this? I had similar issues with moveit, although thay was
        the

        Latest master, I have seen flexible-collision-library/fcl#213 and trying
        the fix right now. Not sure it's the same cause though since we are
        using the newer FCL with methods introduced after 0.5.

        The fix didn't work, however, the segmentation fault goes away when
        turning off ``-march=native`` - which is odd given it's a relatively
        recent i7.

      body: "This has been traced down to the borderline case when primitives are _touching_, i.e. their distance is 0 -- libccd and indep report different collision results for this edge case. INDEP cannot compute contact points on the surface of a sphere, cf. [test_fcl_signed_distance.cpp#L85-L86](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl/blob/master/test/test_fcl_signed_distance.cpp#L85-L86).\r\n\r\nNegative distance queries on spheres using LIBCCD, however, require unreasonable high error tolerances (FCL tests use 15cm).\r\n\r\nFor now I am adding a workaround for the touching case for primitives such that they use the shape centre of _the other object_ as the contact point -- and also replace NaNs with the shape centre for spheres only."

    When using rviz in Hydro, I ran into a dead lock issue, while debugging I
    found the problem in this part of the backtrace:


    ```

    ...

    ```


    `tf2::BufferCore::allFramesAsString` tries to lock the `frame_mutex_` before
    calling `tf2::BufferCore::allFramesAsStringNoLock`, but it has been
    previously locked by `tf2::BufferCore::canTransform` before calling
    `tf2::BufferCore::canTransformNoLock` which in turn eventually calls
    `tf2::BufferCore::allFramesAsString` in some error handling here:

      body: "> What does it mean to reject a goal?\r\n\r\nAn ActionServer can reject a goal if it decides that it cannot complete the client's request. Rejecting is different from aborting, as the latter can only be done with a Goal that has already been accepted (and is either active or preempted). See [wiki/actionlib/DetailedDescription - Server Transitions](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib/DetailedDescription#Server_Transitions) and [wiki/actionlib/DetailedDescription - result topic: Goal information upon completion](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib/DetailedDescription#result_topic:_Goal_information_upon_completion)for more information.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case the `joint_trajectory_action` node would check whether it has ever received any feedback, and if that is not the case, immediately Reject all incoming goals. Without feedback, the server cannot determine whether a goal has been reached, as it cannot compare desired vs actual states.\r\n"

        @mmurooka I think you can use `boost::mutex::scoped_lock` for such a
        critical process. how about add class member variable `boost::mutex
        mutex_;` and add `boost::mutex::scoped_lock lock(mutex_);` on the first
        line of `onInit` and callback functions?

      body: "> @mmurooka I think you can use boost::mutex::scoped_lock for such a critical process. how about add class member variable boost::mutex mutex_; and add boost::mutex::scoped_lock lock(mutex_); on the first line of onInit and callback functions?\r\n\r\nThat seems better."

        Official version of matplotlib is

        14.04: 1.3.1

        16.04: 1.5.1

        18.04: 2.1.1

        So please

        - check if this fix works with 1.3.1 and/or 1.5.1

        - check who is installing latest version of matplotlib via pip

    One possible place for a race condition is in the diff drive setting of
    velocity commands and getting of velocity commands. The kobuki_node sets in
    the ros callback thread, and gets in the kobuki spin thread as its about to
    write to the firmware. Fix this one for groovy.

        I confirmed that this happens when `kobuki*` are installed (although I
        haven't seen without them). [Discussion about its root cause has already
        started](http://groups.google.com/group/ros-sig-rqt/browse_thread/thread/56866547d12c4eff?hl=en).

        If you're usingpublic debian version, root cause of the issue
        (`qt_gui_core` metapackage) is now rollbacked so that this issue should
        not happen (the issue still persists if you use that metapackage from
        source though).

        @bit-pirate, @jihoonl should this issue be closed?
        turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator#17 is closed. The referenced Gazebo issue
        is resolved. I just tried `roslaunch kobuki_gazebo
        kobuki_playground.launch` and found the models to load correctly on the
        initial try.

      body: "@jihoonl , I think the correction is to use `tf::Quaternion::setRPY()` instead of `setEuler()`. Try applying the patch below. Note there are many different conventions in use for \"Euler angles\", which makes the `setEuler()` function somewhat ambiguous. Quick links to relevant tf API documentation are:\r\n* [setRPY](http://docs.ros.org/api/tf/html/c++/classtf_1_1Quaternion.html#ab34dfef6a01c1ece07bea92d485b0576)\r\n* [setEuler](http://docs.ros.org/api/tf/html/c++/classtf_1_1Quaternion.html#aa64600b31d011dbb00dcb151d2d3d241)\r\n\r\nFor comparison, the differential drive plugin in the gazebo_ros_pkgs repository [uses setRPY](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/blob/d32c4a3b5154df99d7b4b467658037209923a28d/gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_diff_drive.cpp#L314). The preceding link is for the tip of [indigo-devel branch](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/tree/indigo-devel) of gazebo_ros_pkgs at time of writing.\r\n\r\nI have tested the below patch for the case of spawning two Kobuki models without using the rocon infrastructure.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/kobuki_gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_kobuki_updates.cpp b/kobuki_gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_kobuki_updates.cpp\r\nindex 81340fc..17ac762 100644\r\n--- a/kobuki_gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_kobuki_updates.cpp\r\n+++ b/kobuki_gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_kobuki_updates.cpp\r\n@@ -105,7 +105,7 @@ void GazeboRosKobuki::updateOdometry(common::Time& step_time)\r\n   odom_.pose.pose.position.z = 0;\r\n \r\n   tf::Quaternion qt;\r\n-  qt.setEuler(0,0,odom_pose_[2]);\r\n+  qt.setRPY(0,0,odom_pose_[2]);\r\n   odom_.pose.pose.orientation.x = qt.getX();\r\n   odom_.pose.pose.orientation.y = qt.getY();\r\n   odom_.pose.pose.orientation.z = qt.getZ();\r\n```"

        Update: The above patch is not sufficient, and indeed, we would not
        expect it to be because there is apparently correct behavior in the case
        of a single Kobuki. I have nearly identified the bug and will report
        soon.

        The bug is due to the different Kobuki plugins using the same ImuSensor.
        I am creating a patch now.

[\" << node_name_ <<\"]\");\r\n```\r\nThe basic problem is that the sensor name, as obtained on [line 289 of gazebo_ros_kobuki_loads.cpp](https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki_desktop/blob/06d8fa710928ba5623939ce42f760838cd0f4667/kobuki_gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_kobuki_loads.cpp#L289) is not scoped. Thus it is the same when multiple models are spawned using the same URDF file, namely kobuki_gazebo.urdf.xacro, which declares the imu name [at line 186](https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki/blob/06e60c2bba4c73699f69ffc61250f1ad152a931a/kobuki_description/urdf/kobuki_gazebo.urdf.xacro#L186). Hence, the sensor obtained by `sensors::SensorManager::Instance()->GetSensor()` is subject to a race condition. I propose avoiding this by using the above patch, which gets the sensor using a fully scoped name that includes the name of the model associated with the Kobuki Gazebo plugin.\r\n\r\nThe relevant Gazebo API documentation is [gazebo::sensors::get_sensor()](http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/api/2.2.1/group__gazebo__sensors.html#gac47a5236e475a51bdad880486fdb9687)."

      body: "Very strange things happen with send seq numbers.\r\nExample: 42, 43, 132, 44, 45, 133, 46, 134, 47....\r\n\r\nLooks like there many instances of mavlink_status_t. Or it'is not synchronized among threads.\r\nAnd i don't see easy way now. I can pull packet parser into interface and drop channel limitation in that part (instead of external storage, which requires channel number allocation, use class members).\r\nAnd this will work with on input side (decode functions don't depend on mavlink_status_t), but not for output because encoding functions does: encode data, set headers *including seq*, calculates crc16.\r\n"

  body: "When I use the setpoint_position plugin to command a pose, the orientation does not behave as expected. To test, I am using the \"2D Nav Goal\" button in rviz with /move_base_simple/goal mapped to /mavros/setpoint_position/local. When I command a North heading, a quaternion of (0,0,0,1) is sent, which mavros converts to a yaw of zero, as expected. As I increase the commanded heading clockwise to South, the quaternion approaches (-1,0,0,0), which converts to a yaw of Pi, as expected. Any further though, and the angle goes to *zero*. Observe:\r\n\r\n[/mavros]: q = (-0.999456, 0.000000, -0.000000, -0.032994) -> yaw = 3.075592\r\n[/mavros]: q = (-0.999550, 0.000000, -0.000000, 0.029986) -> yaw = 0.059980\r\n\r\nThus, yaw setpoints can only be commanded in the [0,pi] range, as the other half of the circle will also map to [0,pi]. The problem must lie in UAS::quaternion_to_rpy() in uas_frame_conversions.cpp, but I'm not sure what the right answer is."

        I'm kinda worried that the current test implemented is forcing the
        function to be "right" instead of getting the right euler angles. Corner
        cases were always a problem of euler angles and that's why probably
        Eigen developers changed the normalized range values that
        `eulerAngles()` method gives. My doubt is: should we normalize the
        values fed to the conversion method or normalize the output? Will we
        want to work in -PI..PI range or 0..2PI?

        My guess at this is that ros params are not set in a blocking call and
        thus they are not available from the parameter server by the time the
        wait topic comes up.

    the gtests in ros_datacentre don't qualify as unit tests as they need a
    mongodb running on a specific port. This fails on the build farm. It should
    be removed or not be enabled by default, IMO.

      body: "yes and no... I'm actually setting up our own STRANDS build farm (it kind of works already) mimicking ROS as far as possible. The rules will be quite strict (actually the same as on ros.org):\r\n* every package is build in its own chroot environment \r\n* dependency resolution is only via rosdep\r\n* every build is a clean build with freshly updated debian packages (also for ROS)\r\n\r\nIf you're curious, check https://github.com/marc-hanheide/rosdistro (forked from the standard rosdistro, but now starting to add our own packages)\r\n\r\nSo, if there are unit test, they must be able to run on a freshly installed ubuntu without any manual intervention. That's also the definition of unit tests. The tests we have implemented are useful, but should be running under a different regime. I plan to do system tests as well in another STRANDS jenkins instance that then has some additional features (GPU, Mira, etc.). I don't know yet how to best configure these in the `CMakeLists.txt` but certainly the current gtest cannot be used (or if so, they need to start their own specific mongodb which still is problematic as ports could clash).\r\n"

        I was adding the tests wrong. I was using the add gtest macro but I
        should be used `add_executable` and `add_rostest`. I'm doing this now.
        Once the renaming is done I will commit this too. And look at the ports

  body: "... and maybe other distributions as well...\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make mongodb fit for\r\ntrusty/indigo.

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nSo we're attempting to setup a hub toplogy using the new listen_mcast and send_mcast settings.  Our hub clients have listen_mcast set to True and send_mcast set to False.  The hub itself has listen_mcast and send_mcast set to True.\r\n\r\nWhen we run in this type of configuration our clients can see the hub just fine (and not each other which is great!) but unfortunately the hub can't see the clients since the client never sends out anything as part of its heartbeat.  We actually need them to see each other as there is topics and services that must be synchronized between the two.\r\n\r\nA simple change that would allow a client to see a hub and vice versa would be to modify the send_heartbeat() to send the master discovery current state to each address in self._address if listen_mcast is True but send_mcast is False:\r\n```\r\n# New method for sending out current state just to addresses that have been detected\r\n def _send_current_state2addresses(self):\r\n        try:\r\n            if not self._send_mcast and self._listen_mcast:\r\n                msg = self._create_current_state_msg()\r\n                if msg is not None:\r\n                    for addr in self._address:\r\n                      rospy.logdebug('Send current state to address %s' % addr)\r\n                      self.socket.send2addr(msg, addr)\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            rospy.logwarn('Send current state to addresses failed: %s\\n' % e)\r\n            self._init_socket()\r\n\r\n def send_heartbeat(self):\r\n      with self.__lock:\r\n            try:\r\n                self._timer_heartbeat.cancel()\r\n            except:\r\n                pass\r\n            invalid_uri = (self.master_monitor.getMasteruri() is None)\r\n            invalid_state = (self.master_monitor.getCurrentState() is None)\r\n            if not (invalid_uri or invalid_state or rospy.is_shutdown() or self.do_finish):\r\n              if self._send_mcast:\r\n                self._send_current_state2group()\r\n             elif self._listen_mcast:\r\n               # So in the case where send_mcast is disabled but not listen_mcast, we allow sending\r\n               # of our state to known addresses (the hubs basically)\r\n               self._send_current_state2addresses()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you think of this.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

        The issue appears to have been fixed based on my initial testing of the
        latest master branch. Thanks!  I consider this solved.  If possible can
        we get the master branch tagged or have a merge into indigo-devel so we
        can start testing the fixes in our larger test bed?

    On the PR2 on Fuerte, the move_base uses 60-70% CPU while actively
    navigating, and performs very smoothly. On Groovy, move_base uses upwards of
    110% CPU while actively navigating, and fails to meet the control loop speed
    of 10Hz, resulting in choppy motion and poor navigation.

When I ran the fuerte nav stack in the groovy environment, it took similar CPU as the groovy version, like the 110% Austin mentioned, but the robot moved smoothly, worked fine.\r\n\r\nI did a \"git bisect\" on the nav stack between fuerte and groovy versions and found that the above-mentioned commit was where the change occurred.  It was not gradual... the revisions before that commit all ran smoothly with similar CPU usage and the revisions after were jerky-all-the-time.\r\n\r\nI have not yet determined the mechanism causing the bug.

The malloc() and free() are called because of the std::vector which is used to accumulate grid cell locations in FootprintHelper::getLineCells().  Looking into stl_vector.h you can see (eventually) that it starts at size 0, then goes to 1, then 2, then 4, 8, etc.  Every time it re-allocates it has to copy all the previous contents into the new memory and then free the old memory."

        I am actively working on this.  I've changed it to a LineIterator class
        which should have similar performance as the "before" code.  First
        though I will test it with the change simply reverted.  PRK is down
        right now so there's a bit of a delay in testing.

        Fixed by 450ba601ae75bc405c0a94e2cb0e6bbe48cc0317.  Subsequent changes
        implement the LineIterator refactoring, which has also been tested on a
        PR2 and drives smoothly.

        Adding "help wanted" tag -- AFAIK there are no active developers with a
        plan to tackle this (would also need to tackle the AMCL-related issue
        mentioned above). If someone is interested in tackling this, please
        speak up!

    It appears there is a waitForTransform call missing before [transforming the
    plan here in L110 of
    goal_functions.cpp](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/groovy/base_local_planner/src/goal_functions.cpp#L110).
    This pops up every once in a while on ROS Answers and users have traced the
    extrapolation error back to the previously mentioned transfom call. See
    examples:
    [1](http://answers.ros.org/question/63360/extrapolation-error-using-hector_mapping-move_base/),
    [2](http://answers.ros.org/question/106996/hydro-move_basetf2-extrapolation-error-into-the-future-errror/),

      body: "Sorry, for the late reply, I'm currently lacking internet.\r\n\r\nI found a  constellation with use_grid_path: true, use_dijkstra: false and start approx end where the loop won't exit The result is a bad alloc exception, when the vector get's too large. That's bad so you need to change something. Unfortunately I'm not familar with the move_base setup. Maybe there are some more parameter which influence this behavior.\r\n\r\nThe image shows the potential when this happens. Here start is cell (390, 75) and end is (391,73). The path toggles around (390,74) and (389,75) infinitely.\r\n![potential](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/941621/4132022/3839ba7c-334d-11e4-801b-f1fd402a6698.png)\r\nSo there might be no minimum at the start position. Thus this is a problem of the potential, not traceback. But it would be nice not to get a bad alloc, when this happens.\r\n\r\nTo answer your questions\r\n1)\r\nAny of the adjacent cells have a value less than 1e10. Thus the original algorithm always finds a (min_x, min_y) and the condition (min_x == 0 && min_y == 0) will never be hit.\r\nThere is at least one case where this results into a bad alloc exception.\r\nWith the change, the condition will be hit eventually.\r\nThis might happen, when start == end, but also when the potential does have local minimas. In the other cases the algorithm should behave identically.\r\n\r\n2)\r\nThis alorithm can not walk upwards. If there's a local minimum it would just walk back and forth until the memory is full. Of course it's up to your, how to handle that case. In terms of computing power the fix is really cheap.\r\n\r\n"

        I've tried the same as @atroyn locally with the new perception
        pre-release from shadow-fixed
        ([perception_pcl#124](https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/pull/124))
        since navigation is the last blocking dependency of my package and I got
        the same error. Obviously, adding the *libproj* dependency did not fix
        the vtk6 issue temporarily. Just wanted to let you know, since I haven't
        seen a navigation devel job running on the buildfarm with the new
        perception release yet. By the way, thanks for the explanation @mintar.

    Unlike GGA, RMC sentences do include an absolute date stamp. When using RMC
    sentences, this data should be used when computing the timestamp instead of
    simply taking the current clock time and adjusting the hours, minutes and
    seconds fields as is done with GGA sentences.

      body: "Please clarify my understanding of the fault description above. It sounds like it says GGA & RMC are used when computing the timestamp for the fix, but they aren't put in the NavSatFix message timestamp, they are emitted as TimeReference on the time_reference topic. Is that what's meant by the above, and the request is to use date from RMC in the time_reference?\r\n\r\nTimeReference is incorrectly built currently - the code assumes utc_time is in seconds, but it is actually hhmmss.ss.\r\n\r\nI guess TimeReference enables syncing system wallclock time to GPS UTC time? I guess it would enable a NavSatFix to be tied back to UTC time, if that were needed for some reason. Is that correct?"

      body: "@shahvi Thanks for making this improvement and iterating on it. I've tested it in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Starting it with a USB GPS sensor and then unplugging the USB cable.\r\n2. Starting it without any USB GPS sensor attached.\r\n\r\nIn test (1), the node exits. In test (2), the node prints FATAL error and exits. This is an improvement over the current behavior, which is to print a Python stracktrace and exit.\r\n\r\nSince this change does not affect the API, it should be a candidate to backport to released versions."

        According to the question, gtest was simply not installed. Not sure if
        you want to close that bug.

        I've been trying to get ROS installed onto the OpenNAO VM. I updated the
        wiki with some fixes, but I couldn't get past the rosdep step. Are there
        any more up to date instructions somewhere? In any case, I'm going add a
        check for gtest in CMakeLists.txt and skip the test if it's missing, and
        close this ticket.

    I have the latest installed and when using pyside on groovy I get this
    error:


    Could not import "pyside" bindings of qt_gui_cpp library - so C++ plugins
    will not be available:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/u/ablasdel/ros_sandbox/ros_gui/qt_gui_core/qt_gui_cpp/src/qt_gui_cpp/cpp_binding_helper.py", line 43, in <module>
        import libqt_gui_cpp_shiboken
    ImportError: No module named libqt_gui_cpp_shiboken



    I have verified I have 2.6 qt-gui-core and the latest rqt (not that it
    matters)

    Currently the checkerboard "world" poses are poorly defined and not easily
    changed. The orientation is hard-coded for the Fetch configuration as to
    where the checkerboard points are relative to the kinematic chain tip link.
    Additionally, there is currently no way to define a starting position, so a
    number of cycles of the optimizer are spent simply moving the checkerboard
    to a relatively good starting position.

      body: "Ok, I had to refresh my memory on the workflow of this one as well:\r\n\r\n * First, [in the CheckerboardFinder](https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/blob/e3d509ca487bc6d847b00be7b0f4c3ce9f50c5fb/robot_calibration/src/finders/checkerboard_finder.cpp#L203), we fill in the \"world\" and \"rgbd\" samples. The rgbd one is fine (that's the coordinates of the checkerboard points within the camera frame).\r\n * The world one is the one we are concerned with. [It's been hacked in the past for particular robots](https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/commit/0cc3420f8c9f4bdc9486e1a3eaa10560cb3eb020#diff-c492b4ea3806f113851c9d45e760b2c7).\r\n * When we enter the calibration phase, we use a \"magic\" extra transform (it's not part of any of the KDL stuff, since there isn't a \"checkerboard\" frame in the robot URDF). [I just added some comments to the key part](https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/commit/2ff79fa4f486d1b3c8ced156243029f8fc236423) (since I couldn't actually find it easily with a search for \"checkerboard\").\r\n\r\nSo then, during optimization, we are optimizing a \"wrist_roll_link\"->\"checkerboard\" offset along with all the other optimization parameters. Ideally, this offset would be almost correct at the start of optimization, especially in angular orientation (otherwise it is the primary source of error). My \"hack\" above is actually just fixing the orientation part, the linear translation still has to be dealt with by the solver -- and obviously it only works for a particular robot.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, there are two approaches to fix this:\r\n\r\n1. continue on the current path and add more parameters to the checkerboard finder -- this has downsides in that you can't update those parameters AFTER a capture, which makes it challenging to actually do the initial tuning of your parameters as well.\r\n2. revert the \"hack\" above so that there are no crazy inversions of the coordinate frames, and add the ability to load initial frame offsets during the optimization. This would allow you to specify the initial state of the \"wrist_roll_link\"->\"checkerboard\" offset. In theory, it also allows lots of other functionality.\r\n\r\nTo do approach 2, we need to:\r\n * Add a new parameter set, perhaps \"free_frames_initial_value\", to the OptimizationParams. The loader can probably [be modeled off this](https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/blob/melodic-devel/robot_calibration/src/optimization_params.cpp#L47).\r\n * Then those [initial values need to be applied here](https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/blob/melodic-devel/robot_calibration/src/optimizer.cpp#L109).\r\n\r\nSide note: the orientation part is especially important -- many times you know/desire that the orientation of the checkboard is fixed in a plane defined by the gripper (the fingers hold the checkerboard parallel to the fingers -- so there is only rotation about one axis). For instance, with Fetch, [only pitch was a free param](https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_ros/blob/indigo-devel/fetch_calibration/config/calibrate.yaml#L41) (with the hack above).\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're actively working on this -- if not, I can whip up a PR if you're willing to test. I don't currently have access to a robot..."

      body: "I appreciate the huge effort that went into that reply. You have to admit the hack is a bit all over the place.\r\n\r\nI don't have enough knowledge of the code to be able to fix it, but I would gladly test it on our robot. Perhaps there could be a way to publish the \"world\" points along with the \"rgbd\" points so I could compare them?\r\n\r\nNow I am wondering if this is why we're having some issues calibrating. We have other things not working so well (mostly a bad motor in the neck), so I'm not 100% sure.\r\n\r\nFor the checkerboard I created a virtual link, with X pointing away from the gripper. I think this is similar to fetch. I also am allowing x,y,z and yaw (not pitch) as free params for the checkerboard frame. See image.\r\n\r\n![calib2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12448106/41054033-2747be4c-69b5-11e8-94b8-61dc00c50de1.png)\r\n\r\nHowever i'm getting pi/2 offset on yaw from the calibration procedure. This suggests that the hardcoded frame does not expect a similar \"virtual checkerboard\" frame to ours?"

      body: "First - I've not used the Orbbec Astra yet. I think you mentioned that the camera was already calibrated separately, but us the pointcloud relatively proper sized? On the older Primesense v1.09 we found that everything was like 90% of actual size (so if you pointed it at a 20cm wide box, you only saw 18cm wide box). There were two \"special\" parameters in their drivers, [which I added support for](https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/blob/melodic-devel/robot_calibration/src/models.cpp#L189).\r\n\r\nSecond - 0.5mm for the checkerboard? Is that right? That seems REALLY small.\r\n\r\nFinally -- the a/b/c values in the YAML file are not RPY -- they are axis-magnitude. I actually wrote the offset load assuming RPY (since that is much easier for people to understand). If we convert the output a/b/c to RPY we get: -1.61582, -0.0352206, -2.97195 -- so ~pi/2 on roll, and pi on yaw. This also explains the \"higher\" value when you initially put things back in. I just checked and when I put the actual RPY values in, the initial and final error are the same."

      body: "Ok, I'm working on a tool for visualization (I have wanted to add one for a while). Right now it's still a mess, but I was able to visualize your bagfile:\r\n\r\nRED = reprojection through arm\r\nBLUE = reprojection through camera\r\nWHITE = first point of any reprojection (helps us to be sure that orientation is correct)\r\n\r\nFirst, a single checkerboard reprojection (the first one in your bag). I've applied the offsets (after fixing for RPY as in my last comment):\r\n![screenshot from 2018-06-07 11-39-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/899410/41110816-515c46e2-6a48-11e8-9839-f278271a4cb5.png)\r\n\r\nSo I would say that orientation is correct -- that's a huge start. Error is also relatively small in this first pose (sub centimeter).\r\n\r\nNow the full set of poses:\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-06-07 11-37-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/899410/41110771-31d4cb78-6a48-11e8-957f-0c263d313302.png)\r\n\r\nFrom this I have several comments:\r\n * The error gets much worse in the upper poses (~2-3cm) so a proper calibration will be very useful there.\r\n * Most of your poses are along a \"diagonal\" from lower right to upper left. We don't have much data in the upper right or lower left quadrants of the workspace.\r\n * Similarly, there isn't much variation in angle of the wrist. Most of the lower right quadrant have similar (within 10 degrees) orientation. This means there isn't much data for the calibration to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      body: "Thanks @mikeferguson  -- for the feedback and for the tools you are providing. So, for the small things:\r\n\r\n1. Our Astra S looks good, we compared against laser and the scaling is fine.\r\n2. I meant that I measured the checkerboard size with 0.5mm precision, it's actually 20.5mm as you saw in the config files\r\n3. Oh man I didn't realize the abc-rpy thing. Maybe should also be mentioned in the README ? Thanks for the lesson!\r\n\r\nAnd for bigger things:\r\n\r\n- Today I was adding offset handling to our drivers (dynamixel). Took me a while to realize I should **add** the values when getting motor state and **subtract** when setting desired state. After applying the values mentioned before, we could finally grasp something in open loop! Tomorrow I will be using the new visualization tools (thanks!!) to check everything.\r\n\r\n- Unfortunately our arm's reachable space is not that high, and to make things worse we don't have a joint position controller for the neck. We will be adding this so that we can capture different configurations. And I will be more careful with rotating wrist. In general, is it more important to have variation in the last or first joint?"

      body: "RE: abc-rpy: yeah, at the moment, the ability to load initial values isn't in the main line yet -- before it ends up there it will get documented. I've also added the \"to_rpy\" tool so that people can do that conversion easily.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the workspace -- it's ok to have a smaller workspace (and thus smaller area in which you collect data). However, it's important that you have a decent distribution of data in both cartesian space and joint space. It's not about having more variation in a particular joint, it's about having some samples that collect data with a wide range of every joint. Taken to an extreme, imagine you collected data with one of the joints having never moved, you have very little information about this joint. If you then set it to a free parameter, it might bias the system in some direction."

        Waiting for CI, but it appears that this is sort of a false alarm. ceres
        1.9.0 changes the way gradient_tolerance is applied as a condition for
        convergence. The original test is actually already converged (hence, it
        really shouldn't run). I've updated the original test to remove those
        checks, and added a new test that has a baked-in error that is easy to
        test for convergence:

Should the `lookupTransform` call instead by a `waitForTransform`?"

      body: "Would you happen to have a bag file that I can use to aid in looking into this, or is the data proprietary? I used to have a call to waitForTransform there, but I found that it was causing timing issues if a given transform wasn't available. For example, if the transform required for sensor 1 isn't available yet, then waitForTransform will wait the full amount of time before it stops blocking and execution can proceed. This means that if a given transform drops out or isn't available, then the rate of measurement processing effectively drops to 1/wait_for_transform_time for all the sensors in the system. I have a few options here, one of which is to use the tf message filter (and I have been meaning to add that anyway). Another option is to first attempt to get a transform at the specified time (which is what I'm doing), catching the exception (doing this too), but then trying again with ros::Time(0) as the requested time, which will essentially just get the latest available transform.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'll label this as a bug and look into it. Thanks!"

        After a quick look at the raw data, I see your IMU data is in the odom
        frame. I have an open issue (issue #22) for fixing the way I'm handling
        the IMU frame. For now, if you change the frame_id of your IMU data to
        base_link, or give it its own "imu" frame and then make a static
        identity transform from base_link to imu, it will stop trying to apply
        its own transform.

      body: "Ah, interesting. The imu/data topic is actually being produced on the PC from a data_raw topic, using [imu_filter_madgwick](https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/imu_tools/blob/master/imu_filter_madgwick/src/imu_filter.cpp). The imu/data topic itself is in the imu_link frame just like data_raw, which is supplied by the URDF/robot_state_publisher. I think the fix will probably be just to disable imu_filter_madgwick from publishing the odom->imu_link TF.\r\n\r\nI'll give that a shot tomorrow and report back. Thanks very much for being willing to check this out."

        No problem! Just so I'm clear, you mean that the /imu/data topic is in
        the imu_link frame just like the imu/data_raw topic, but its message is
        being reported with 'odom' as its frame_id? In the bag file you
        provided, the header on imu/data has odom as its frame_id, and
        robot_localization is (currently) going to attempt to transform all IMU
        data into the base_link frame before using it. Apologies if that's what
        you were saying and I'm being dense. It's late. :)

        Son of a gun, you're right. That is highly unexpected behaviour from the
        imu filter; now investigating further.

        I bypassed it in the commit above and added a warning log so we can see
        if it happens incorrectly in future. I believe it can only happen when
        killing the windows while they are still trying to spawn, which is not a
        bug. If the user decides to shutdown so early, then he can clean it up.
        Adding infrastructure to wait around to check and cleanup is too much
        overhead right now.

        Really stumped on this one. The above was reproduced with a two minute
        gap between starting and stopping. Could easily check this and ignore
        the problem, but doesn't help understand why the problem is there.

There are probably other cases like that lying around.\r\nIn our case losing network is expected and nothing fatal.\r\nI think it should probably be handled at a low level in ros to make everything more robust with intermittent connections... unless ROS people usely expect things to break when network breaks ? \r\nI ll dive in more shortly."

It would make more sense to me to have the timestamp change with every message. Is there a reason it doesn't?\r\n\r\n\r\nchange log:\r\nChanged 15 months ago by kwc \r\n\r\nsimilarly,\r\n\r\n https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5192\r\n\r\nrostopic doesn't subscribe to simtime, so the timestamp is always walltime\r\n\r\n\r\nticket 5192 follows:\r\n\r\nWhen I have gazebo running, \"rostopic pub\" fills the time stamp with the wall time instead of the simulation time:\r\n```\r\n<launch>\r\n  <param name=\"/use_sim_time\" value=\"true\" />\r\n\r\n  <node name=\"gazebo\" pkg=\"gazebo\" type=\"gazebo\" args=\"-u $(find gazebo_worlds)/worlds/empty.world\" respawn=\"false\" output=\"screen\"/>\r\n\r\n  <node pkg=\"rostopic\" type=\"rostopic\" name=\"fake_wheel_joint_states\"\r\n    args=\"pub -r 1 /joint_states sensor_msgs/JointState '{header: auto, name: [dummy_joint], position: [0.0]}'\" /> \r\n</launch>\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the stamp is filled with wall time; also, the time stamp doesn't change:\r\n```\r\n$ rostopic echo /joint_states\r\nheader: \r\n  seq: 1\r\n  stamp: \r\n    secs: 1317580589\r\n    nsecs: 692742109\r\n  frame_id: ''\r\nname: ['dummy_joint']\r\nposition: [0.0]\r\nvelocity: []\r\neffort: []\r\n---\r\nheader: \r\n  seq: 2\r\n  stamp: \r\n    secs: 1317580589\r\n    nsecs: 692742109\r\n  frame_id: ''\r\nname: ['dummy_joint']\r\nposition: [0.0]\r\nvelocity: []\r\neffort: []\r\n---\r\n```\r\nThis seems to be caused by this line:\r\n```\r\n# disable /rosout and /rostime as this causes blips in the pubsub network due to rostopic pub often exiting quickly\r\nrospy.init_node('rostopic', anonymous=True, disable_rosout=True, disable_rostime=True)\r\n```\r\nWouldn't it be more sensible to enable rostime if\r\n\r\nrostopic is called with the '-r' parameter (in other words, it won't exit quickly), and/or\r\nthe parameter use_sim_time is set?\r\nCurrently, \"rostopic pub\" is almost useless in simulation.\r\n\r\nticket 5192 change history:\r\nChanged 15 months ago by gerkey \r\n\r\nowner changed from gerkey to kwc\r\nThis ticket should really move to the ros Trac, but the TicketMoverPlugin seems have been disabled or removed in the recent server upgrade.\r\n\r\nChanged 15 months ago by martin_guenther \r\n\r\nOoops, sorry about that. I actually started off at the right entry page ( https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/) without realizing that this was already the entry page, saw the list of available tracs and clicked right through to ros-pkg, since that seemed to fit best.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the entry pages of the ros, ros-pkg and wg-ros-pkg tracs could have a message at the top saying something like \"This is the bug tracker for the ROS core software (e.g. ROS client libraries, roslaunch, rostopic). To file a ticket, log in and select \"new ticket\" on the right.\" (like on  http://www.ros.org/wiki/Tickets). Perhaps this would help with other people like me who can click faster than they can think.\r\n\r\nChanged 15 months ago by kwc \r\n\r\nstatus changed from new to closed\r\nresolution set to duplicate\r\nduplicate:\r\n\r\n https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3174\r\n\r\nChanged 15 months ago by kwc \r\n\r\nstatus changed from closed to reopened\r\nresolution duplicate deleted\r\nactually, this is different (read to fast, reopen)\r\n\r\nChanged 15 months ago by kwc \r\n\r\nstatus changed from reopened to closed\r\nresolution set to duplicate\r\nrather than fix the ticket move plugin, I updated 3174 with the additional detail of simtime vs. walltime as it's generally the same block of code at fault. Unfortunately, it's also a tricky block of code to fix as it requires a general API rewrite.\r\n\r\n"

      body: "I have the same Issue, the clock stops to be published while all other topics are published fine. \r\nI play multiple bag files with over 6 camera streams and one pointcloud stream played from an SSD drive.  \r\n\r\nIssues start when I subscribe to all camera streams and the pointcloud stream. Stopping nodes (Unsubscribing) brings the clock back to live. But this makes the --clock unusable in my case even with lower play rates this happens depending on the ammount for subscribed topics of the bag file. Its simply to unreliable, the nodes and nodelets which should process the data are sleeping forever in my case while the other topics of the bagfile are published and no error is visible. Only subscribing to /clock shows the issue. \r\n\r\nThe issue was also hard to find because the first 20 loops auf my processing nodes run fine, but than they stopped without any reason (sleep). So I debugged my nodes allot just to find the clock is not published after 20 loops (All nodes startet up).\r\n\r\nI would expect that the topics from the bagfile are not published when clock gets not published. (with option --clock)."

        The problem comes from too much time spend by "rosbag play" (player
        class) to publish messages, which happens when there are tpo many
        subscibers to a topic and/or too many messages to publish in a short
        period of time. In these case, the publishing loop for /clock (lines 310
        in player.cpp) is just skipped, and /clock is never published. I send a
        fix to force /clock to be publish from times to times in this case.

      body: "[snorri] The nodelet's clean exit and the rosmaster exception would happen together at the same time, which is why I brought them up together. I think the third part, the warning about the wall timer can be ignored, because it isn't in sync with the previous two events, so its probably related to something else.\r\n\r\nI managed to find a few extra details about this a little bit by accident. End result, I have a simple test nodelet now which runs a single service that is launched with roscore on the robot, and a cpp client which communicates with it. \r\n\r\nGetting some backtraces, the problem occurs around bond::onHeartbeatTimeout which is where the exit is getting triggered. If adding a warning when the bond is getting broken, I see this on the server's side:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n[ INFO] [1302690669.063968904]: Received: encoders\r\n[ INFO] [1302690669.094750234]: Received: encoders\r\n[ INFO] [1302690669.116592072]: Received: encoders\r\n[ WARN] [1302690670.970057050]: Heartbeat timeout is enabled, breaking bond (topic: nodelet_manager/bond, id: /dude_5beb8285-4a44-462e-b9e5-ff1ac2140491)\r\n[ WARN] [1302690671.318677873]: Heartbeat timeout is enabled, breaking bond (topic: /nodelet_manager/bond, id: /dude_5beb8285-4a44-462e-b9e5-ff1ac2140491)\r\n[dude-2] process has finished cleanly.\r\nlog file: /home/yujin/.ros/log/08704240-65b8-11e0-926c-0001291b9b12/dude-2*.log\r\n[ERROR] [1302690671.323944482]: received a tcpros connection for a nonexistent service [/dude].\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, the master throws the above exception.

      body: "Seems like we hit this issue again - though with a different system and in a different situation:\r\n\r\nWe use a decent SBC (Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4130T CPU @ 2.90GHz, 8GB RAM, SSD), but run quite a lot of nodes and nodelets. During operation our robot moves in and out of our WiFi's coverage. This can lead to the network manager sometimes invalidating the WiFi connection, e.g. if it gets unresponsive. To handle this we are currently using a \"harsh solution\" which involves restarting Ubuntu's network manager.\r\n\r\nRestarting the network manager can lead to broken bonds between the nodelet manager and its nodelets. This occurs usually during the launch, but can happen also during runtime.\r\n\r\nAfter digging further my impression is, that in this special situation the processing of the callback queue responsible for the bonds update is blocked for some time. Hence, the heartbeat timeout timer is reset too late and the bond is terminated.\r\n\r\nWe were able to trigger a similar delay, when triggering a service call shortly before the network manager restarts. In this case the response takes several seconds and the bonds break as well (depends on the timeout set).\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that all of this occurs on the same machine. That is, there is no active ROS connection (topics, services, active) over the WiFi connection. The above tests were done being connected to the SBC by SSH over wire.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no clue why the service calls are blocked. It seems like something is blocking the rosmaster. And we also don't know why this blockage affects the bonds.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what we could test and investigate to find further clues.\r\n"

      body: "@bit-pirate @mikaelarguedas This might be related to the older rospy bug with the synchronous vs asynchronous publish behavior. \r\n\r\n@bit-pirate As of Kinetic we've switched bond to use the more robust asynchronous rospy api by default: https://github.com/ros/bond_core/pull/10 Could you test a backport of the newer versionm 1.7.17 ? It's only been released into Kinetic pending testing, but if it's shown to fix a bug a more active backport could be considered. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is on a local machine, the network interface potentially going up and down may block in a similar manner to the wifi dropping out.

        @tfoote For my tests I have been working with the latest bond_core
        sources, which include the PR you linked. So, unfortunately this issue

        Was this ever resolved? I think I have the same problem now running ROS
        Kinetic on an UAV. Sometimes when we fly and when we possibly have bad
        WiFi connection or a connection that is restarting (we have a script
        that will restart things regularly of needed). But it only happens a
        couple of times per flight test and nearly never in the lab so very hard
        to debug...

        [rdiankov] right, that only changes whether the messages shows on the
        screen or not. from your response, i thought these stale connections
        shouldn't be happening at all, but if they are a normal part of the
        operation then i have no complaints.

        The problem still exists. A workaround is to not unregister publisher
        sockets and leave them dangling. However, this is not very clean and
        might result in memory exhaust for a long-running process.

        https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/issues/138 (and the

        avoid unregistering the closed connections
        https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/pull/322 which is not a
        very a stable solution.

The latter produces erroneous statements, saying:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe following migrations need to occur:\r\n * From: tf/tfMessage [94810edda583a504dfda3829e70d7eec]\r\n   To:   Unknown\r\n    1 rules missing:\r\n     * From: tf/tfMessage [94810edda583a504dfda3829e70d7eec]\r\n       To:   Unknown\r\n * From: asebaros/AsebaEvent [49995036bad52e061c5fd515a11fffd7]\r\n   To:   Unknown\r\n    1 rules missing:\r\n     * From: asebaros/AsebaEvent [49995036bad52e061c5fd515a11fffd7]\r\n       To:   Unknown\r\n * From: marxbot_navigation_driver/Holes [f79b3052041f645c20f1cb9fee7adc96]\r\n   To:   Unknown\r\n    1 rules missing:\r\n     * From: marxbot_navigation_driver/Holes [f79b3052041f645c20f1cb9fee7adc96]\r\n       To:   Unknown\r\n * From: marxbot_navigation_driver/Prox [27b203bc6c0c45a3a402103ddc9ce94a]\r\n   To:   Unknown\r\n    1 rules missing:\r\n     * From: marxbot_navigation_driver/Prox [27b203bc6c0c45a3a402103ddc9ce94a]\r\n       To:   Unknown\r\n * From: lb_vision_driver/VisionData [f8bbeced64c960ab6a67ac05beb4925a]\r\n   To:   Unknown\r\n    1 rules missing:\r\n     * From: lb_vision_driver/VisionData [f8bbeced64c960ab6a67ac05beb4925a]\r\n       To:   Unknown\r\n```\r\nNote the statement about tf. This is wrong, as the tf message from /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/geometry/tf has the right checksum, as shown by\r\n\r\n```\r\nrospack find tf\r\n/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/geometry/tf\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\ngrep 9481 /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/geometry/tf/msg_gen/cpp/include/tf/tfMessage.h \r\n    return \"94810edda583a504dfda3829e70d7eec\";\r\n```\r\nAlso note that both bags where created with fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04\r\n\r\nTherefore, I guess there is a bug in rosbag."

It also eliminates any possibility of port collisions with other, non-ROS programs."

  body: "ROS_MASTER_URI will not accept an IP address unless there is an entry which resolves a hostname to said IP. Without such an entry in /etc/hosts, the command 'ROS_MASTER_URI=\"http://10.1.1.1:11311/\" rostopic echo $TOPICNAME' will still connect to a running topic but will not display any published data. As soon as an entry is added into /etc/hosts, the command works correctly and as expected. \r\n\r\nConsider this scenario:\r\n\r\nI have a server with the IP 10.1.1.1 and the hostname 'server', on the server I execute this script: http://paste2.org/p/2599990.\r\n\r\nOn a client, if I attempt to execute the command 'ROS_MASTER_URI=\"http://10.1.1.1:11311/\" rostopic echo TIMESPAM' it connects to the server, but does not display any data.\r\n\r\nThen, on the client, if I add an entry into /etc/hosts such that the hostname 'server' is bound to 10.1.1.1, a fresh execution of the command 'ROS_MASTER_URI=\"http://10.1.1.1:11311/\" rostopic echo TIMESPAM' will immediately work correctly.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an issue with the client needing to know the hostname of the server, despite the fact I'm passing the IP address as the URI - and the behavior of the issue may lead somebody to assume that the problem is elsewhere in the system. \r\n\r\nThe issue is also on answers.ros.org - http://answers.ros.org/question/50225/why-does-ros-need-a-hostname/\r\n\r\nI'm marking this as critical, as this is not only blocking some applications of ROS use (ie dynamic IP network), but also may cause developers to assume another component of the system is broken in the case that a successful connection is made, but no data received.\n\ntrac data:\n * Owner: **dthomas**\n * Reporter: **boardincol**\n * Reported at: **Thu Dec 13 15:34:29 2012**\n * URL: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/4071"

        [jfaust] subscription callbacks work per advertiser, but latched topics
        are really meant more for topics that only a single publisher is
        publishing on (like the map).

        [tfoote] With people using nodelets more this can start to produce
        unexpected errors, and it would enable libraries from using latched
        topics.  In particular we are looking at libraries which used latched
        topics for bulk updates with a parallel channel with delta updates.

The upside is that this approach would ensure that all subscribers would receive the latest message from each publisher, but the downside is that existing subscribers will get repeated messages when new subscribers come up.\r\n\r\nShort of refactoring how publishers and latching works I don't think we can fix this..."

      body: "For other people running into this issue, there's a pretty easy work-around with rospy to the poor behavior in this bug.  Instead of using a rospy.Publisher, use a LatchPublisher as shown below.  One gotcha is that, because of the underlying Publisher singleton, the queue_size must be large enough for all Publishers on the same topic, and each instantiated Publisher/LatchPublisher overwrites the queue_size specified for the previously-instantiated Publisher/LatchPublisher.\r\n\r\n    class LatchPublisher(rospy.Publisher, rospy.SubscribeListener):\r\n        def __init__(self, name, data_class, tcp_nodelay=False, headers=None, queue_size=None):\r\n            super(LatchPublisher, self).__init__(name, data_class=data_class, tcp_nodelay=tcp_nodelay, headers=headers, queue_size=queue_size, subscriber_listener=self, latch=False)\r\n            self.message = None\r\n    \r\n        def publish(self, msg):\r\n            self.message = msg\r\n            super(LatchPublisher, self).publish(msg)\r\n    \r\n        def peer_subscribe(self, resolved_name, publish, publish_single):\r\n            if self.message is not None:\r\n                publish_single(self.message)\r\n"

  body: "I am using this call method from a ServiceClient:\r\n{{{\r\n  template<class MReq, class MRes>\r\n  bool call(MReq& req, MRes& res)\r\n}}}\r\n\r\ntracing the execution, this goes into service_server_link.cpp\r\n{{{\r\nbool ServiceServerLink::call(const SerializedMessage& req, SerializedMessage& resp)\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nthe problem seems to be that the finished_condition_.wait() call here never terminates.\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n    boost::mutex::scoped_lock lock(info->finished_mutex_);\r\n\r\n    while (!info->finished_)\r\n    {\r\n      info->finished_condition_.wait(lock);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nusing:\r\nhttps://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/tags/latest/core/roscpp\r\nr9871\r\n\r\nThis happens almost every time.\r\nI believe my setup had incorrect MD5 sums (however, no error or warning mentioned this). At some point, the node providing the service crashed (potentially caused by the MD5 sum error). I kept this setup until I found the hanging call to the condition. Doing rosmake in my build fixed all the problems.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the potential issues with the build I used and the service provider node, I believe there should have been warnings about the MD5 sum being different and the code should not hang.\n\ntrac data:\n * Owner: **dthomas**\n * Reporter: **isucan**\n * Reported at: **Thu May 27 10:08:33 2010**\n * URL: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/2742"

        [straszheim] Thanks for the great test case.  Should be fixed in r15057,
        will watch hudson for a bit to see how things go.

        [straszheim] Was a little overly agressive checking for the condition. 
        Real fix should be in r15058.  Watching hudson again.

        [gerkey] Indeed, it's been unfixed by r15289.  r15295 disables the test
        for this bug.  It should be re-enabled after it's re-fixed.

        10.7.4, and I was wondering if there is a workaround for this issue.  I
        am running a few different nodes which each have several persistent
        services running, and I encounter this same problem when executing the
        ros::service::call method between the nodes.

        [lorenz] I'm reassigning the ticket to Tully since Ken is not at Willow
        anymore and I don't know who is maintaining roscpp at the moment. I
        personally think that this ticket is describing a severe problem that
        should be addressed quickly.

        Just a short note because I came across this ticket: Setting the
        `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` socket option should be enough (on linux) to make
        this work. Of course, you cannot be sure that the call *actually*
        failed, or if you just failed to get the response. I still believe it is
        better behavior to notify the caller that something is taking too long
        instead of waiting indefinitely.

        I recently ran into this problem. I had to work around the issue by
        running the service call in a separate thread so that I could decide
        whether or not the call was taking to long to return. I'm guessing that
        this issue has taken a back seat in favor of encouraging people to use
        actionlib, but in this case I was working with a product and the service
        call was part of their API.

        Any progress on this issue? I'd like to +1 this feature. Having a
        timeout is very very useful particularly since service calls are

  body: "We discussed this the other day, but I don't think that anyone actually filed a ticket to track it. There is currently a race between when a subscriber object is assigned to whatever variable the user is storing it in, and when a callback is called. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nros::Subscriber s;\r\n\r\nvoid subCreator(){\r\n  ros::NodeHandle n;\r\n  s = n.subscribe(\"topic\", &cb);\r\n}mm\r\n\r\nvoid cb(MessageConstPtr msg){\r\n  s.unsubscribe();\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nWhen unsubscribe is called on s, the subscriber may be invalid, or worse, in some unknown state of initialization (since copying of shared_ptrs is not guaranteed to be thread safe). This could cause very rare but incredibly hard to track down crashes in all sorts of programs. I believe the proposal to fix this is to have to call some sort of start() method on the subscriber object in order for callbacks to be called.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to fix this is that people build tools to look like our ROS Publisher and Subscriber and they may inherit this bug. For example, a similar bug exists in actionlib and almost existed in Stu's new bond code.\n\ntrac data:\n * Owner: **straszheim**\n * Reporter: **eitan**\n * Reported at: **Mon Jul 26 16:00:19 2010**\n * URL: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/2924"

        [eitan] I talked to Brian again about this today as I was removing the
        auto_start option from actionlib code. He pointed out that the problem
        only exists with multi-threaded spinners. As long as callbacks are
        serviced from the same thread in which the subscriber creator is
        created, this shouldn't be a problem. However, it would be a problem
        with a multi-threaded spinner. It might be worthwhile to see if we can
        actually get this race to occur. We might also consider adding an option
        to subscriber objects to not start servicing callbacks automatically to
        allow them to be used in multi-threaded systems. Thoughts?

        [jfaust] There's a potential way to solve this transparently, which is
        to have `subscribe()` return something different than the `Subscriber`
        object, say, a `SubscriberInit` object, and `Subscriber` has a
        constructor that receives one.  Then, once the subscriber is
        constructed, it causes the actual subscribe to happen.

      body: "[mihelich] Just noticed this ticket. There's a similar issue with `Publisher` and connection callbacks. It caused most of the instability with the nodelet-ized OpenNI pipeline and took me forever to track down. When you advertise, it's possible for your connection callback to get called before the `Publisher` member variable is assigned. For example:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nros::Publisher p;  // outputs\r\nros::Subscriber s; // inputs\r\n\r\nvoid onInit()\r\n{\r\n  ros::SubscriberStatusCallback cb = boost::bind(&MyNodelet::connectCb, this);\r\n  p = getNodeHandle().advertise<FooMsg>(\"foo\", 1, cb, cb);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid connectCb()\r\n{\r\n  if (p.getNumSubscribers() == 0)\r\n  {\r\n    // If p is not assigned to yet, we wrongly take this branch!\r\n    s.shutdown();\r\n  }\r\n  else\r\n  {\r\n    s = getNodeHandle().subscribe(...);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nWhen writing a nodelet, you're *very* likely to hit these races. When you load a nodelet, you already have multiple worker threads waiting to process callbacks.\r\n\r\n+1 on returning a `SubscriberInit` proxy object (and `PublisherInit` for `Publisher`). It doesn't solve Stu's counter-case, but I don't think you ever need to use `Subscriber*` since `Subscriber` is already lightweight and has an uninitialized state."

        [leibs] The attached patch adds support for the getSubscriptions and
        getPublications xmlRpc calls.  Could I get someone to double-check and
        see if there is anything glaringly wrong in what I've done?  I've been
        living in python and bash land for too long to trust myself to commit to
        roscpp trunk at this hour.

        [leibs] Troy thought the patch seemed reasonable and I double-checked it
        just now. I just pushed the change in r12744 since I'm blocked on it to
        close a rosbag ticket.  I'm leaving this ticket open for someone to
        implement the remaining xmlrpc slave api calls.

      body: "[mihelich] I've noticed this issue with unsubscribe callbacks too. However, it's not true that they're never called; they *do* get called exactly 60s after you subscribe.\r\n\r\nIn practice this shouldn't normally be an issue. In each nodelet we use connect callbacks to control whether it hooks into a data source (camera or ROS topic). As long as it's getting data, it publishes some processed output. So if all subscribers to the output unsubscribe, the next call to `publish()` triggers the disconnect callback, which unhooks from the data source. So as long as you're streaming data, disconnects will be timely.\r\n\r\nIt's still annoying and can cause odd behavior in practice - e.g. if the register nodelet doesn't get the tf data it needs, it can't `publish()`, so it takes the full 60s to disconnect. So I'd like to see this fixed, or at least know why it happens.\r\n\r\nI've been hacking a lot on the OpenNI drivers recently and there were other connection-callback-related bugs in that code. The biggest issue was that all the nodelets had a race condition on startup - when you do something like `pub_ = it_.advertise(\"image\", 1, cb, cb);` in `onInit()` you have to be careful. An `image_transport::Publisher` takes some non-negligible amount of time to create, so if a waiting subscriber connects immediately the connect callback can be scheduled onto a nodelet worker thread and called before `pub_` gets assigned to. Then the connect callback sees `pub_.getNumSubscribers() == 0` because `pub_` is empty. Yay nodelets.\r\n\r\nI'm working to get all affected stacks released now that I'm back. If you want all the fixes now you also need image_pipeline and nodelet_core, see http://answers.ros.org/question/2993/registered-depth-only-works-sometimes-with."

      body: "[adolforodriguez] I haven't verified the internals of roscpp, but the 60s timeout sounds like it may have something to do with TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT, which defaults to 60s for linux kernels > 2.2 (before it used to be a whooping 180s). The value can be verified by running cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout\r\n\r\nWhat condition must be verified for the unsubscribe() callback to be triggered?. If it's socket resource release, then this takes place by default 60s after the socket has been closed. When a socket connection is closed it follows the state sequence: ESTABLISHED -> CLOSED_WAIT ->TIME_WAIT. Citing [1]:\r\n\r\n\"TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT: This setting determines the time that must elapse before TCP/IP can release a closed connection and reuse its resources. During this TIME_WAIT state, reopening the connection to the client costs less than establishing a new connection. By reducing the value of this entry, TCP/IP can release closed connections faster, making more resources available for new connections.\"\r\n\r\nAny chance that this is related to the problem at hand?.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.speedguide.net/articles/linux-tweaking-121"

        [mihelich] That sounds plausible, and should be easy to test. The
        relevant socket code should be in `TransportTCP`:
        http://ros.org/doc/unstable/api/roscpp/html/transport__tcp_8cpp_source.html.
        Or maybe `PollSet`:

        Yeah, it is a problem where the debian packages installed for travis do
        not make it into the virtualenv for python. But I fixed it. Thanks.

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI just discovered a deadlock that is happening quite often (once or twice a day in continuous operation) in my application.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that `ros::ServiceManager` has an internal `shutting_down_mutex_`, which is usually held by all functions operating on the manager.\r\n\r\nIn my case, the call chains (read from top to bottom) are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFirst thread:\r\n  ros::service::call()\r\n  ...\r\n  ros::ServiceManager::createServiceServerLink() (acquires the shutting_down_mutex_)\r\n  ...\r\n  TransportTCP::initialize()\r\n  ...\r\n  TransportTCP::enableWrite() (tries to acquire TransportTCP::close_mutex_)\r\n\r\nSecond thread:\r\n  TransportTCP::socketUpdate() (acquires the TransportTCP::close_mutex_)\r\n  ...\r\n  TransportTCP::close()\r\n  ...\r\n  ServiceManager::removeServiceServerLink() (tries to acquire the shutting_down_mutex_)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the `ServiceManager::shutting_down_mutex_` should only be held while checking `ServiceManager::shutting_down_`. But it's hard to tell without a comment on the mutex whether it is also supposed to protect against running `ServiceManager::shutdown()` while another method is already running. Can someone shed light on that?\r\n\r\nHere are the full backtraces from gdb (sadly without debug information):\r\n\r\n```\r\nFirst thread:\r\n\r\n#0  __lll_lock_wait () at

One path locks A and then tries to acquire B while the other locks B and then tries to acquire A. That is a classic problem of inconsistent lock hierarchies. I am not sure though how it can be changed to use the same lock order in both cases."

        That would certainly break the protection the mutex is providing. If the
        `createServiceServerLink` method would release the lock after the check
        the `shutdown` method could run. And then after the shutdown function
        has completed the `createServiceServerLink` could continue with the rest
        of the function body leaving the service manager in an inconsistent
        state.

      body: "Okay, that's what I expected. We have the same situation on the other side in `TransportTCP` then.\r\nA comment on the mutex about what it is actually protecting might be nice ;-)\r\n\r\nAs you said the real problem is the locking order. I'd say it's not a good idea to let the low-level `TransportTCP` hold a mutex while calling the high-level `ServiceManager` object.\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/8713a1e22f69535a88b1a2f9c3b6a4c73abf6cf1/clients/roscpp/src/libros/transport/transport_tcp.cpp#L672 , do we need to hold the close_mutex_ while calling the callback? Any operations on the `TransportTCP` instance would acquire the lock anyway.\r\n\r\nMoving that call out of the scope would break the deadlock, I think."

        I agree that calling the high-level function while having the
        `close_mutex_` locked is "wrong". But again, you can't just reduce the
        locking scope here. The callback is supposed to read from the socket. If
        the mutex does not cover that a concurrent thread can trigger the close
        of the connection and the socket gets cleaned up while the read is about
        to happen.

        Well, I'm not sure. I was tracking some deadlocks, and I want to use
        -fsanitize=thread to track them. For now, it mostly track the deadlock
        you see in transport tcp, so I think it would be good to fix that
        first.

    calling unlockAndPublish() causes the RealtimePublisher to make a syscall.
    If I comment out that line from my code, I don't see any syscalls.


    What other information would you guys need to track this down?

  body: "When switching controllers, the robot hardware abstraction might require changing the control mode of certain resources (e.g. joints). This feature was contributed in #200. I recently realized that the current implementation has an important flaw with a straightforward fix.\r\n\r\nWhen a controller switch request is made, a non real-time ROS callback checks that the switch is possible, and among other things calls [`RobotHW::canSwitch(...)`](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/blob/indigo-devel/controller_manager/src/controller_manager.cpp#L475). This callback doesn't perform the actual switching, but [delegates it](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/blob/indigo-devel/controller_manager/src/controller_manager.cpp#L95-L108) to the [real-time] control thread. Because of this, the call to `RobotHW::doSwitch(...)` should also be done in the control thread. We currently do it in the [ROS callback](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/blob/indigo-devel/controller_manager/src/controller_manager.cpp#L483), which is wrong.\r\n\r\nThis misplaced call to `RobotHW::doSwitch(...)` can cause a robot to switch the control mode of its joints before the new controllers are actually running. The ensuing behavior is undefined, and depends on how your hardware abstraction is implemented. I could reproduce this on hardware, and confirm that the fix proposed below address the issue.\r\n\r\nThe fix consists of moving the execution point of `RobotHW::doSwitch(...)`, which entails that the method implementation must now be **real-time safe**. A fix for indigo is proposed in #209.\r\n\r\nBecause the real-time safe requirements now imposed on `RobotHW::doSwitch(...)`, it now becomes much likelier that `RobotHW::canSwitch(...)` will have side-effects, i.e., change the state of the `RobotHW` instance. For this reason, I additionally propose that in jade we [remove the constness](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/commit/f19abeabfbd58ec986de507099ba62ef9291d778) of the `RobotHW::canSwitch(...)` method. Since jade has not been officially released, we can allow to make this small API change. A fix for jade is porposed in #210.\r\n\r\n@ipa-mdl "

      body: "You are right it might lead to undefined behaviour if this case is not handled properly in RobotHW, which is rather cumbersome.\r\nBut mode switching might take longer than 1 update cycle, so I am not sure how to integrate it in `update()` properly.\r\n\r\nFor CANopen it takes 2 to 10 (rough estimation) cycles to switch the mode depending on the device, which might require to switch the motor power off and on again.\r\nTo overcome this, I stop the motor motion in `ros_canopen` until the controller was switched (i.e. the first command was sent).\r\nIn my current implementation `doSwitch` blocks until all requested motors were switched properly, but this does not effect unrelated motors and controllers.\r\nI can rewrite it to non-blocking behaviour (to be used in `update()`), but the undefined state for the controllers would still be present, since it takes longer than 1 cycle to switch and `ControllerManager` does not know anything about the internal state.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's time to add proper resource states that are used for switching and detection of emergency stops, something like\r\n* STOPPED: no (claiming) controller is assigned\r\n* ERROR: controller is assigned, but resource is in error state\r\n* SWITCHING: resource is not driven currently, needs time to switch\r\n* READY: everything is finde\r\n\r\nIn addition we would need a mechanism to propagate the state between `ControllerManager` and `RobotHW`.\r\nBut this needs changes throughout the code and a notable amount of work."

      body: "Currently `switch_controller` is required to be an atomic operation that can take place in a single control cycle. I'm open to discuss alternative strategies, but would prefer to not change current behavior unless no sensible alternative solutions exist. Non-atomic switching opens many questions, such as, what happens while switching completes?, will my robot fall?, is there any control?.\r\n\r\nWe've also encountered devices that take longer than one control cycle to switch.The following is a list of possible solutions that can be made to work with the single-control-cycle restriction of `switch_controller`. In all cases `doSwitch` must be real-time safe, hence non-blocking. Not all might apply to your setup.\r\n\r\n* Keep last command from controller being stopped, or set it to an uninitialized value (e.g. NaN). If mode switching takes longer than one cycle, the controllers will switch (stop/start) before the new mode configuration kicks in. It might be acceptable to keep the last commands of the stopped controller (which are constant, as they are no longer being updated) for a few more cycles.\r\n\r\n* Disallow certain mode transitions in `RobotHW::canSwitch`. If mode switching is really slow, and there is no policy that can be applied at the `RobotHW` level (as proposed above), maybe it doesn't make sense to allow it at runtime, or at least make you first stop one controller, then start a new one from controlled conditions (but not really switch). Truly reactive behaviors need switching in a single control cycle.\r\n\r\n* Change your hardware (or at least the electronics) for something that has acceptable switching behavior. This is easier said than done, I know. Some hardware simply require you to start sending a different type of command, and the switching is done transparently to you (I think UR arms work like this).\r\n\r\nYou say you're using CANopen. IIRC, the CANopen state machine should be able to transition between any to modes in two control cycles, right? (mode A→idle, idle→mode B). This is what we're getting from CAN devices.\r\n\r\n"

        @ipa-mdl, please let me know what strategy you propose to go about this.
        I don't want to break `ros_canopen` without reason, but would also not
        want to leave this bug open for long. I'll be offline for the next three
        weeks, so there's no immediate rush.

I'd like this behavior to remain, as it's one of the strong points of the controller manager. The `prepare_switch` alternative breaks this guarantee. Also, it's brittle to rely on the robot being standstill to run `prepareSwitch`, as the mechanism might be moved by external factors and not remain still.\r\n\r\n> If you do want to bloat the API any further, I have to hijack canSwitch for the preparation, it's ugly but will work.\r\n\r\nYes, please.\r\n\r\nI don't know what you mean by ugly, but option 1 in https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/issues/211#issuecomment-138242512 is a pretty decent compromise, and has worked well for us in joints that take a few cycles to switch.\r\n\r\nIf switching is really slow, I'd advise to go for option 2 in https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/issues/211#issuecomment-138242512, but I think this can likely be prevented using option 1.\r\n\r\nI don't want to put pressure here, but I consider this bug a blocker for the Jade release."

      body: "Long answer...\r\n\r\n> Option 1 does not work if the controller starts before the hardware is ready to process the commands.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it works for you, but this is the sequence of events I'm expecting when switching from `ctrl_a`, which runs in `mode_a` to `ctrl_b`, which runs in `mode_b`:\r\n\r\nWhen switching is requested:\r\n- `doSwitch` is called to go from `mode_a` to `mode_b`\r\n- `ctrl_a` stops, and its commands (belonging to `mode_a`) stop changing over time\r\n- `ctrl_b` starts in `mode_b`\r\n\r\nDuring a few control cycles:\r\n- hardware is busy switching mode. If it's still in `mode_a`, it will keep following the last command sent by `ctrl_a`, which is no longer updating, since `ctrl_a` is stopped. If the robot is standing still, then no observable change should take place.\r\n- `ctrl_b` is writing commands that don't reach hardware, as it hasn't completed the switch to `mode_b`.\r\n\r\nOnce hardware switches to `mode_b`:\r\n- hardware starts following commands sent by `ctrl_b`. Again, if the robot was standstill, no observable change should take place.\r\n\r\nDuring switching, the first commands from `ctrl_b` will get lost, and the last written command of `ctrl_a` will be used. Do you see this as a show stopper?.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, how is this worse than what you currently have?. I expect that you have the opposite. You switch modes before controllers, hence start reading from a still stopped `ctrl_b` while `ctrl_a`'s commands go nowhere.\r\n\r\n> Hijacking is ugly because I have to run the `doSwitch` tasks in `canSwitch`, relying on the fact that nothing can prevent the controllers from starting/stopping within the `ControllerManager` logic.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understood the above phrase. But if we accept that controller switching cannot take longer than one control cycle, I see no big issues with offloading most of the work to `canSwitch`, and have `doSwitch` only commit the changes. More below...\r\n\r\n> In addtion `canSwitch` is const in indigo.\r\n\r\nTo go over this limitation in indigo, I had to make `mutable` the data structure that `canSwitch` prepares for `doSwitch`. This is why the `const` qualifier of `canSwitch` is being dropped in #210 (jade).\r\n\r\n> A compromise would be to rename `canSwitch` to `prepareSwitch`, non-const with boolean return type.\r\n\r\n`canSwitch` [already](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/blob/fix-do-switch-jade/hardware_interface/include/hardware_interface/robot_hw.h#L122) returns bool and is non-const in #210. The `prepareSwitch` name sounds appropriate. Since mode switching is not a widely used feature, I'm OK with considering renaming the method for jade.\r\n\r\n>If you insist on #209 (or the jade equivalent) then this is a blocker for all further `ros_canopen` releases.\r\n\r\nI've been holding #209 and #210 because of your heads-up. A fix *has* to be pushed to indigo and jade, but it can be delayed. I'm all ears for feedback from affected downstream projects like `ros_canopen` to make the transition as smooth as possible.\r\n\r\n> I am not aware of other driver implementations that use the switching feature already.\r\n(If there is any, please let us know, your feedback is highly appreciated!)\r\n\r\nOur worst switching latency is two 10ms control cycles, and we observe the behavior described in the example above. It's more than acceptable. The code is not open."

      body: "Thank you for your detailed response!\r\n\r\n> During switching, the first commands from ctrl_b will get lost, and the last written command of ctrl_a will be used. Do you see this as a show stopper?.\r\n\r\nFor a single joint this might be acceptable, but it is not acceptable for synchronized multi-joint motions.\r\nThe CANopen standard does not list any timing bounds for switching a mode.\r\n\r\n> You switch modes before controllers, hence start reading from a still stopped ctrl_b while ctrl_a's commands go nowhere.\r\n\r\nYes and no: Commands from `ctrl_a` go nowhere, but I do not forward `ctrl_b`'s commands (to be more specific: the command from the `JointHandle`) until all motors have switched their mode. Motion is halted in between. For this to work I have to postpone the start of the controller. (Logic for same mode switch is different)\r\n\r\n> I see no big issues with offloading most of the work to canSwitch, and have doSwitch only commit the changes.\r\n\r\nI guess this is the crucial point. In CANopen committing the change takes some time.\r\nCurrently ros_canopen does not enforce to motor to stillstand be before switching (again synchronously for all affected joints), but that's already on my list.\r\nAnd I want the controller to have a clean start for all it's resources.\r\n\r\n> Our worst switching latency is two 10ms control cycles\r\n\r\nTwo cycles is our best case. Typical latency will be 3-4 cycles for *our* hardware. Other hardware needs some additional state machine transitions in between and therefore 5 or more cycles just for the (synchronized) communication. If the motor needs to be stopped first (with moderate deceleration) the time increases of cause.\r\n\r\n> canSwitch already returns bool and is non-const in #210. The prepareSwitch name sounds appropriate. Since mode switching is not a widely used feature, I'm OK with considering renaming the method for jade.\r\n\r\nThen it's fine for jade, a rename would be nice though.\r\nWhy can't we backport it to indigo?\r\nA const `canSwitch` (marked deprecated) and a non-const version of whatever name that are both called. Or the latter might even call the first per default.\r\nThis way the HW interface developers can migrate easily. In addition the non-const implementation will work for indigo and jade.\r\n\r\nIMHO breaking the behaviour (non-RT -> RT) is worse than breaking the API (const -> non-const).\r\n"

    There is currently no synchronization between the non-rt thread that
    executes the subscriber callback and the rt thread that runs the controller

        I am a bit concerned about adding __sophus__ as a dependency even if it
        gets removed later. I know it's a PITA but can that part be removed from
        this PR? It would make assessing the changes easier if a new library is
        not brought in especially if it is later removed (because then we have
        to review that the removal changes indeed keep functionality).

  body: "This is a follow-up of #10 (fix: on destruction OutputHandlerROS should restore the previous handler).\r\n\r\n### Problem Description\r\nWhile for Linux the proposed fix works nicely and avoids the pure virtual method call demonstrated by the `cleanup` unit test, on macOS the added call to `console_bridge::restorePreviousOutputHandler()` in the destructor of `OutputHandlerROS` triggers an exception because [this mutex](https://github.com/ros/console_bridge/blob/master/src/console.cpp#L60) in `console_bridge`'s [`static DefaultHandler DOH`](https://github.com/ros/console_bridge/blob/master/src/console.cpp#L69) struct has already been destructed when the call to `console_bridge::restorePreviousOutputHandler()` tries to lock it during the static destruction of [RegisterOutputHandlerProxy](https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/src/bridge.cpp#L48]).\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error: mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\r\nProcess 13839 stopped\r\n* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = signal SIGABRT\r\n    frame #0: 0x00007fffb664fd42 libsystem_kernel.dylib`__pthread_kill + 10\r\nlibsystem_kernel.dylib`__pthread_kill:\r\n->  0x7fffb664fd42 <+10>: jae    0x7fffb664fd4c            ; <+20>\r\n    0x7fffb664fd44 <+12>: movq   %rax, %rdi\r\n    0x7fffb664fd47 <+15>: jmp    0x7fffb6648caf            ; cerror_nocancel\r\n    0x7fffb664fd4c <+20>: retq\r\nTarget 0: (rviz) stopped.\r\n(lldb) bt\r\n* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = signal SIGABRT\r\n  * frame #0: 0x00007fffb664fd42 libsystem_kernel.dylib`__pthread_kill + 10\r\n    frame #1: 0x00007fffb673d457 libsystem_pthread.dylib`pthread_kill + 90\r\n    frame #2: 0x00007fffb65b5420 libsystem_c.dylib`abort + 129\r\n    frame #3: 0x00007fffb510994a libc++abi.dylib`abort_message + 266\r\n    frame #4: 0x00007fffb512ec17 libc++abi.dylib`default_terminate_handler() + 243\r\n    frame #5: 0x00007fffb5c3d713 libobjc.A.dylib`_objc_terminate() + 124\r\n    frame #6: 0x00007fffb512bd49 libc++abi.dylib`std::__terminate(void (*)()) + 8\r\n    frame #7: 0x00007fffb512bdc3 libc++abi.dylib`std::terminate() + 51\r\n    frame #8: 0x000000010229a11b librosconsole_bridge.dylib`__clang_call_terminate + 11\r\n    frame #9: 0x000000010229a13d librosconsole_bridge.dylib`rosconsole_bridge::OutputHandlerROS::~OutputHandlerROS() + 29\r\n    frame #10: 0x00007fffb65b6178 libsystem_c.dylib`__cxa_finalize_ranges + 332\r\n    frame #11: 0x00007fffb65b64b2 libsystem_c.dylib`exit + 55\r\n    frame #12: 0x00007fffb652123c libdyld.dylib`start + 8\r\n(lldb)\r\n```\r\n(after quitting rviz with ROS kinetic built from source on macOS Sierra 10.12, with system dependencies installed from HomeBrew, with console_bridge 0.4.0 and rosconsole_bridge version 0.5.1)\r\n\r\nI could not reproduce this problem for \"normal\" executables that only link statically to dynamic libraries, but the exception is triggered consistently if the application loaded libraries dynamically at run-time (`dlopen()`, e.g. through pluginlib) that directly or indirectly link to `librosconsole_bridge.dylib`.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is likely the different ordering of Linux and Darwin during the static initialization and destruction phase. While Linux initializes all global symbols right after a dynamic library has been loaded, Darwin only initializes them on first use. Apparently that is what is called \"[deferred dynamic initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization#Deferred_dynamic_initialization)\" in [1], which is allowed by the C++ standard [2]. The destruction happens in strictly reverse order of initialization in both cases, where the completion of the constructor or dynamic initialization is the synchronization point [3].\r\n\r\nIf the construction of [OutputHandlerROS](https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/src/bridge.cpp#L48]) called during static initialization of [oh_ros](https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/src/bridge.cpp#L126) from the [constructor of RegisterOutputHandlerProxy]([https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/src/bridge.cpp#L124) finishes before the first call to [getDOH()](https://github.com/ros/console_bridge/blob/master/src/console.cpp#L67), which in turn initializes the mutex as part of the static initialization of [DefaultOutputHandler DOH](https://github.com/ros/console_bridge/blob/master/src/console.cpp#L69), the mutex also gets destroyed before the [destruction of oh_ros](https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/src/bridge.cpp#L48), which calls into [console_bridge::restorePreviousOutputHandler](https://github.com/ros/console_bridge/blob/master/src/console.cpp#L88) and tries to lock it.\r\n\r\n### Proposed patch\r\nThe solution is to make sure that the output handler is restored during the destruction of exactly the same object that installed a new one, namely `RegisterOutputHandlerProxy`. If it's not the constructor of `OutputHandlerROS` that calls `console_bridge::useOutputHandler(this)`, it should also not be the destructors responsibility to call `console_bridge::restorePreviousOutputHandler()`.\r\n\r\nNote that there might be more than one instance of `RegisterOutputHandlerProxy` in a single process because it can be instantiated once for every compilation unit that included the [REGISTER_ROSCONSOLE_BRIDGE](https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/include/rosconsole_bridge/bridge.h#L60) macro that defines the symbol `rosconsole_bridge::RegisterOutputHandlerProxy __register_rosconsole_output_handler_proxy`, depending on whether it is loaded with [RTLD_GLOBAL](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/dlopen.html) or not, and they refer to either the same or a different instance of [static OutputHandlerROS oh_ros](https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/src/bridge.cpp#L126).\r\n\r\n### ABI compatibility (tested on Xenial only)\r\nI think the same reasoning about ABI-compatibility as in https://github.com/ros/rosconsole_bridge/pull/10#discussion_r59419426 applies to this patch, too:\r\n```\r\n$ abi-compliance-checker -l rosconsole_bridge -old rosconsole_bridge-0.5.1.dump -new rosconsole_bridge-fix.dump \r\npreparation, please wait ...\r\nWARNING: version number #1 is not set (use --v1=NUM option)\r\nWARNING: version number #2 is not set (use --v2=NUM option)\r\ncomparing ABIs ...\r\ncomparing APIs ...\r\ncreating compatibility report ...\r\nresult: COMPATIBLE\r\ntotal \"Binary\" compatibility problems: 0, warnings: 0\r\ntotal \"Source\" compatibility problems: 0, warnings: 0\r\nsee detailed report:\r\n  compat_reports/rosconsole_bridge/X_to_Y/compat_report.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as the definition of `RegisterOutputHandlerProxy` has been changed, which is actually instantiated in another compilation unit (e.g. `liburdf.so`), we also have to test this one:\r\n```\r\n$ abi-compliance-checker -l urdf -old urdf-0.5.1.dump -new urdf-fix.dump \r\npreparation, please wait ...\r\nWARNING: version number #1 is not set (use --v1=NUM option)\r\nWARNING: version number #2 is not set (use --v2=NUM option)\r\ncomparing ABIs ...\r\ncomparing APIs ...\r\ncreating compatibility report ...\r\nresult: COMPATIBLE\r\ntotal \"Binary\" compatibility problems: 0, warnings: 0\r\ntotal \"Source\" compatibility problems: 0, warnings: 0\r\nsee detailed report:\r\n  compat_reports/urdf/X_to_Y/compat_report.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat being said, even if ABI compatible, if only rosconsole_bridge would be recompiled/upgraded, but not the compilation unit that expands the [REGISTER_ROSCONSOLE_BRIDGE](https://github.com/rhaschke/rosconsole_bridge/blob/04d37b29f181696588f1780507e1a73fcab21cb5/include/rosconsole_bridge/bridge.h#L60) macro and instantiates `RegisterOutputHandlerProxy`, none of the two destructors would be called which might result in the pure virtual method call during static destruction again.\r\n\r\n### Unit test\r\nThe [add_test()](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/add_test.html) call in [test/CMakeLists.txt:4](https://github.com/meyerj/rosconsole_bridge/blob/ef57ce056c886566720d524e9db0104d743d9ab1/test/CMakeLists.txt#L4) was missing a `NAME` keyword, which is why it always failed for me when running through the target `test` generated by cmake, because it tried to execute a command called `COMMAND`. Also note that the unit test is not using [catkin's test infrastructure](http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/run_tests.html) which defines the targets `tests` and `run_tests` and only provides macros for nosetests and gtest. It will not run automatically on `make run_tests` or [on the ROS build farm](http://build.ros.org/job/Kdev__rosconsole_bridge__ubuntu_xenial_amd64/8/console). In order to fix that catkin should provide a macro like `catkin_add_test()` that is not specific to a certain testing library and can execute arbitrary commands, but which integrates with its `run_tests` target.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n[1] https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization#Deferred_dynamic_initialization\r\n[2] http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.start.dynamic#4\r\n[3] http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.start#term-3\r\n\r\n"

      body: ">> In order to fix that catkin should provide a macro like catkin_add_test() that is not specific to a certain testing library and can execute arbitrary commands, but which integrates with its run_tests target.\r\n\r\n> Does catkin_run_tests_target satisfy this? That function is being used when registering a gtest or nosetests test.\r\n\r\nIn principle yes, but it would still require some glue like in [catkin/gtest.cmake:81-89](https://github.com/ros/catkin/blob/964f1bf385f356c8345677928801947d497a161e/cmake/test/gtest.cmake#L81-L89) that has to be repeated for each test executable and that could be wrapped in its own catkin function:\r\n\r\n```cmake\r\nfunction(catkin_add_test target\r\n  cmake_parse_arguments(_testing \"\" \"\" \"COMMAND\" ${ARGN})\r\n  # unparsed arguments are forwarded to catkin_run_tests_target()\r\n\r\n  # make sure the target is built before running tests\r\n  add_dependencies(tests ${target})\r\n\r\n  if(NOT _testing_COMMAND)\r\n    # get_target_property() may be replaced by a generator expression in modern CMake?\r\n    get_target_property(_target_path ${target} RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)\r\n    get_target_property(_target_executable ${target} RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME)\r\n    set(_testing_COMMAND \"${_target_path}/${_target_executable }\")\r\n  endif()\r\n\r\n  # The test executable does not produce a junit result file plain-${target}.xml, but\r\n  # we have to add one in the catkin_run_tests_target() call...\r\n  catkin_run_tests_target(\"plain\" ${target} \"plain-${target}.xml\"\r\n      COMMAND \"${_testing_COMMAND}\"\r\n      DEPENDENCIES ${target}\r\n      ${_testing_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS})\r\nendfunction()\r\n\r\n# in test/CMakeLists.txt\r\nadd_executable(cleanup cleanup.cpp)\r\ncatkin_add_test(cleanup)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function would create a custom `run_tests_${PROJECT_NAME}_plain_cleanup` target that runs the test executable through the [run_tests.py](https://github.com/ros/catkin/blob/964f1bf385f356c8345677928801947d497a161e/cmake/test/run_tests.py) wrapper and that gets added to the `run_tests` target, but because it does not produce a junit test result file on its own, the wrapper returns with a failure. I guess what would be needed is another wrapper (or a patch to `run_tests.py`) that generates a simple result file for plain tests which only records the exit code, without tracking individual test cases, instead of checking that the test executable created a result file.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to make `xunit_filename` an optional argument to [catkin_run_tests_target()](https://github.com/ros/catkin/blob/964f1bf385f356c8345677928801947d497a161e/cmake/test/tests.cmake#L94) and call the executable directly if it is not specified. But I am not sure how this would interact with [catkin_test_results](https://github.com/ros/catkin/blob/964f1bf385f356c8345677928801947d497a161e/bin/catkin_test_results) and report generation at the build farm."

    There were basically 20-30 rosdoc jobs which were running for several hours
    preventing the build farm from turning over.  There needs to be  a timeout
    mechanism to prevent this.  Most of the jobs usually only take 3-5
    minutes.

  body: "It seems that several jobs failed due to merge conflicts.  This should be caught and handled.  I believe we discussed that if the tags had a conflict to just ignore it and they'll be added later upstream.

        These conflicts are actually happening because I have a bug in my code.
        I solved the merge conflict problem by splitting the database into
        separate files... so it really shouldn't happen very often. I think I
        know what's up will look into a fix now.

        I think that this should be fixed as of
        https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/jenkins_scripts/commit/0b55ab91b77904c5d22c7ee716cb2ea184713125
        but I'll wait to close until we see the jobs passing again.

  body: "I ran into an inconsistency of timestamps on our robot: I get a timestamped message from a roscpp-node. Upon receipt, I call ```(roslisp:ros-time)```. I print both stamps, and the roslisp timestamp is older than the one from roscpp. This seems like a bug to me.\r\n\r\nI checked that both my roslisp-node and my roscpp-node run on the same computer and that ```use_sim_time``` is set to false on the ROS parameter server. This relates to roslisp version 1.9.17 on ROS Hydro, Ubuntu Precise.\r\n\r\nI looked into how roslisp implements its time mechanism. I am doubtful whether the two global variables ```*time-base*``` and ```*internal-time-base* ``` used for calculating the stamp refer to the same moment in time. If they do not, than the timestamp could be wrong by as much as +-1s. \r\nhttps://github.com/ros/roslisp/blob/master/src/time.lisp#L46\r\n\r\nAre there alternatives in SBCL to ```(get-internal-real-time)``` which give us a real-time with respective to a globally known reference time? Or should we consider wrapping the c-functions for accessing the sys-time?"

        My guess might also be wrong, because, now that I look closer, right
        inside the same ```(ros-time)``` function there is a call to
        ```(mutex-owner *debug-stream-lock*)``` which is an SBCL-specific
        function. So, if you try the ```get-time-of-day``` and it turns out to
        work better than ```get-universal-time``` I wouldn't object to using it
        instead...

        Right. roslisp is already very SBCL specific. Porting it to other Lisp

        compilers would be quite some effort. I would just go ahead and use

        whatever SBCL function fixes the problem.


        Btw. if you don't want to change the official release, you can also
        think

        about monkey-patching roslisp.

        @airballking Any update on this? I've noticed problems with cl-tf
        timestampes before, if sbcl time function solves the problem that would
        be nice. Have you tested this yet, Georg?

    I am trying to implement rosserial on an STM32F0 (ARM-based) board. When I
    try to connect to the board using serial_node.py, the code running on my
    board segfaults in rosserial_msgs/TopicInfo.h (which I generated using the
    latest version of make_library.py) at the memcpy functions. If I change my
    topic name to be 8 characters, I don't get the error. It seems that
    rosserial doesn't check that writes are block-aligned on 32-bit platforms.

        Note that I've worked around this temporarily by [using protocol
        buffers](https://github.com/danep2/rosserial/tree/protobuf). The
        maintainer of rosserial has stated that he does not want to incorporate
        protocol buffers though, so a proper fix is still needed.

        I just realized I've seen this problem - thanks for reporting it Dane -
        I didn't know what caused it. The EmbeddedLinux version of rosserial was
        throwing alignment error messages to the console. It has to be this
        problem. It prevents use of rosserial on arm platforms, which is a
        growing problem - should be a problem on Arduino Due too. Needs to be
        fixed.

      body: "@chuck-h thanks for the info!\r\n\r\nA workaround is to do:\r\necho 2 > /proc/cpu/alignment\r\n\r\nhowever, as mentioned in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/mem_alignment, this is very slow and not a proper solution.\r\n\r\nIf you compile the code with -Wcast-align you'll see all the problematic lines in the code. Basically it's in TopicInfo.h, RequestParam.h and Log.h and the offending instructions are things like:\r\n\r\n    uint32_t * length_topic_name = (uint32_t *)(outbuffer + offset);\r\n\r\nwhere (outbuffer + offset) is a char*. This clearly shows the misalignment.\r\n\r\nNow these files are generated from python code and I really don't have enough grasping of it to change it. Does anybody have an idea about how to fix it that doesn't involve protobufs? It's a pity that a module targeted to embedded systems has problems with ARM processors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        Hi @chuck-h , I've seen your contribution too! I think we're both doing
        the same in a slight different way. We will see if the maintainer
        accepts any of two solutions.

        @pbouffard Please ignore those warnings for now. They are issues with
        the formatting of catkinized package.xml files in packages that rqt
        depends on, they shouldn't cause you an trouble and will be fixed before
        the beta is over.

        After getting to know catkin a bit I managed to build both qt_gui_cpp
        and rqt_gui_cpp from source. With the locally built libraries this
        problem does not occur, so I could not get a BT with more debug symbols
        in it...

      body: "You're right, the segfault only occurs when opening a python plugin or closing the gui. For me it actually only happens when opening rqt_plot or rqt_py_console.\r\n\r\nBut the backtrace shows that the segfault happens in the Python garbage collector. So this cannot really be the fault of any Python code, but has to be a problem with the C++ extension and the garbage collector is just triggered by some Python code in the plugins. (For rqt_plot it happens on the statement ```from matplotlib.figure import Figure```)\r\n\r\nIn fact, when I delete ```libqt_gui_cpp_sip.so``` the problem is gone:\r\n```sudo rm /opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qt_gui_cpp/libqt_gui_cpp_sip.so```\r\n(This also explains, why there is no problem, when running with PySide, as there currently is no PySide C++ extension in the packages...)\r\n\r\n@dirk-thomas in conclusion:\r\n- the problem is reproducible with groovy debs on precise\r\n- it disappears when manually deleting ```libqt_gui_cpp_sip.so``` (and does not occur with PySide as there is no lib in the debs)\r\n- it is not reproducible with locally build libs of the same source version (qt_gui_core: 0.2.6, rqt: 0.1.4-20-gb8aa2a9)\r\n\r\nSo it seems this is a problem with the C++ extensions built on your buildserver."

        I can reproduce the segfault on an Oneiric machine when building
        qt_gui_core and rqt from source and rest from Debians. Surprisingly with
        pluginlib also from source (which are only headers!) the segfault
        disappears...

        The C++ binding are usually difficult to deal with. You might want to
        check the PySide version you are using (try a newer version if
        available?) and try to debug into the code why it fails in your case.
        Without being able to reproduce the problem I can't give you any better
        advise, sorry.

    Setting up ros-groovy-rqt (0.1.4-s1354065869~precise)

    Result was disappointing:
    ```

    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
      what():  basic_string::substr

    After repeating enable-disable rqt_robot_monitor many (more than several
    dozens of) times on rqt_pr2_dashboard, rqt_gui segfaults.


    Happens on @ablasdel's machine, but does not on mine (kept clicking for 5+
    minutes x 2 times).


    My environment:

    ros-groovy-pr2-power-drivers/precise uptodate 1.0.9-s1354565896~precise

    rqt commit 9eb8faadedaa6fa3dfafb020c0f89b6ee43c208c


    To  @dirk-thomas, @ablasdel

    I even commented out graveyard but no difference.

    Playing back a bag file with --clock doesn't work. The clock is only
    published 2 or 3 times per second, and doesn't appear to increase linearly.


    I suspect the issue here is that rospy is using the clock it's publishing
    and creating some kind of feedback look.


    The GUI is also unresponsive while playing back my bag files; this may or
    may not be related to timer issues caused by using --clock.

        Did some more testing. rqt_bag publishes and behaves normally when not
        using `--clock`

        I suspect the performance issue here is a result of some very serious
        lock contention issues, as a result of:

        - Each publisher in rqt_bag is handled by its own thread
        (MessageListenerThread)

        - Each of these threads is attempting to publish the clock

        - The rospy publisher has an [internal
        lock](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/indigo-devel/clients/rospy/src/rospy/topics.py#L817-L825)
        to make it thread-safe


        I'm going to attempt to rewrite the clock publishing so that it listens
        to the playhead position rather than individual messages, and so that it
        accepts the `--hz` option that I need for my use case.

        More evidence that this is a locking issue: the clock is published
        monotonically if I use the `--clock` option in conjunction with "Publish
        All Messages", which forces all messages in the bag file to be published
        sequentially.

        beyond the clock problem (that appears to be fixed by #340), rqt_bag
        fails to publish heavy data (i.e. a bag with data from multiple
        velodynes) in real time: I get 3Hz per device vs 36Hz with rosbag (it
        skips a lot of packets)

        I have the same issue, except rqt_bag skips a lot of tf packets, even if
        the "Play all Messages" option is set. This seems like a serious
        problem, since it's difficult to visualize a bag if the robot is
        teleporting around.


        If I use rosbag play instead of rqt_bag, everything runs fine.


        Is there a current workaround for this?

        I have similar problems. When I start rqt_bag with --clock, open a .bag
        file and start playing it the /clock is not published at first. When I
        click in the rqt_bag window, the /clock starts publishing. When the
        timeline reaches the end and the marker loops back, the /clock stops
        being published. Then I have to click again in the rqt_bag window in
        order for the /clock to be published again.

Switching this to a lazy load of topic type will probably solve the problem.

When you want to use rqt_plot, launch it with 'rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot -e'.  This option will start the plotter without attempting to restore previous topics.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

This could be adjusted to taste but seemed a good balance)\r\n\r\nAt the moment I think I will forgo the popups with the full name since this worked out so nicely and the right click/view by topic gives you a way to view them anyway. \r\n\r\nI will clean it up and pull it.\r\n\r\nOne thing I do notice. The last bit of the topic name is probably the most important. I think I might make it so that that portion is never trimmed or at least trimmed later than most."

        I bumped my test to 20000Hz and was able to get it pretty unresponsive.
        At this point we may be at the limit of sanity here. I will check on my
        buffering code to see if I am doing anything that would add to the
        unresponsiveness at high data rates.

        I've discussed this with Austin and he agreed that the rate that froze
        his rqt_console was probably more like 13kHz or more. While I agree we
        should fail more gracefully than slowing down so drastically at this
        kind of data rate this is is probably a bit beyond the scope of what is
        reasonable to expect rqt_console to handle. For example in a side by
        side test at the same data rate rxconsole doesn't fare much better. I am
        still going to look at my message buffering to see if I can't improve it
        but time is probably better spent on other bugs after that point.

        @gustavovelascoh Thanks for reporting. We're watching answers.ros.org
        actively and I'm already aware of [your
        post](http://answers.ros.org/question/72739/cant-plot-some-messages-types-on-rqt_plot/),
        which I'm trying to replicate but haven't been able to see the same
        issue so far. Let's keep talking there, and if we figure out that it's
        an issue then we can reopen this ticket (ref.
        http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support).

        Can we re-open this issue? I am still having issues with this. I have
        done an `apt-get update` as well as `apt-get install --reinstall
        ros-groovy-rqt-top`, but it still breaks other applications using psutil
        (in this case, Spyderlib).

      body: "I'm not sure we really have a way of specifying if they are \"valid\" for a given parameter given the definitions in the dynamic reconfigure server. I think it is possible for dynamic reconfigure to report a `NaN` value regardless of the range specified...I'm not sure about `Inf`. This is honestly a little fuzzy for me, and I can't find any documentation.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could clarify if the validity of 'Nan', '-Inf' and 'Inf' are influenced by the specified range in a double parameter's definition.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could add a checkbox somehow for `NaN`? Maybe in a context menu? I know that *setting* a `NaN` or `Inf` value is a pretty rare use case, so I'd rather not make a UI change that would affect the majority of users...\r\n\r\nSo to answer your question, yes, I think we could, but we need to think about how this works in dynamic reconfigure before we consider `rqt_reconfigure`, I think."

        If the limits for a parameter are specified as infinite, does it make
        more sense to use a logrithmic or exponential scale for the slider,
        rather than a liner scale?

Maybe we can make this a context menu selectable option, but I think that the current behaviour is acceptable.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I think that the `-Inf` and `Inf` scenario is handled well (considering https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/pull/241 of course).

      body: "Thanks for the report. It looks like that `numpy` was added in #239 but the dependency was not declared in the manifest. I created #396 to fix that.\r\n\r\nIn general you should not install dependencies using `pip` but via `apt` instead (in this case `python-numpy`). Simply because your apt packages can be updated as part of a declared dependency and the pip packages won't get updated and even overlay a potentially newer version installed from Debian packages. So using pip package is asking for trouble in the future."

    Similar to Issue #53 but the phenomenon is different. Thus opened as a
    separate issue.


    On `rqt_launch` when I open `demo.launch` from `pr2_moveit_config` pkg, no
    nodes are shown, nothing happens on GUI and I only see this on commandline:


    ```

    Traceback (most recent call last):

    ```


    Both of these just indicate that `roslaunch` cannot open certain `.launch`
    files. So `rqt_launch` has to be able to handle them, notify them to the
    users.

    `rospy.has_param` fails to catch an exception that occurs from
    `/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py`. But since I've only seen so far this issue
    with very specific situation using `rqt_moveit`, i'm reporting it as
    rqt_moveit issue for now.


    Stacktrace:


    ```

    [INFO] [WallTime: 1366848119.366552] PluginContainerWidget;

    Reproduction steps:

    1. Run `Moveit!` on PR2 (here I don't describ how to do so)

    2. Run `rqt_moveit` on your machine

    3. Once it starts showing the monitored topics, toggle monitor some of the
    topics, then expand the tree for some of them. Repeat this until you see the
    error.


    `has_param` throws `ROSException`, which is [handled like
    this](https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_robot_plugins/blob/7604936b849e6e3b2cf5e2d6c3577a04b5964fc2/rqt_moveit/src/rqt_moveit/moveit_widget.py#L230).

    steps to duplicate

    execute the UnderstandingTopics tutorial
    (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics)

    leave the rqt_plot open for an extended period of time.

    You will see the following:

        From the screenshots it looks like rxplot also has this problem (maybe
        not as strong), is that correct?

        Then I would guess this has something to do with the MatPlot backend.

        Could you try to reproduce this with the PyQtGraph and QwtPlot backends?
        (selectable form the settings menu)

        Yes it happens on rxplot too but it does seem more pronounced on the rqt
        version.

        I will try to reproduce on the other plotters today.

        Tested QwtPlot and it doesn't seem to happen (so far I will continue
        running this to be sure)


        After fixing a bug in pyqtgraph in
        pyqtgraph/graphicsItems/PlotItem/PlotItem.py:


        ```
                if name is not None and self.legend is not None:
        ->
                if name is not None and hasattr(self, 'legend') and self.legend is not None:
        ```


        It also doesn't seem to happen.

        It looks pretty clear that this is a MatPlot bug.


        Perhaps we should depend on one of the other packages and make it the
        default?

        Just to note it gets really bad and really slow after awhile of running.
        I talked with some people here and they mentioned this slowness has been
        an issue in rxplot for some time.

        I had a quick look at the MatPlot backend code which someone ported form
        rxplot and it looks like the calculation of the axes bounds might be the
        problem, as it calculates the min and max y values over the complete
        data sequence...

        I made a quick change to only use the last 100 data points, which should
        prevent this from happening.

        Could you check if this was the reason and if it looks better now?

        Still this is just a dirty hack and I think we should rather depend on
        the PyQtGraph library, but it is not the Ubuntu package repos...

        Otherwise someone has to take a deeper look into making the MatPlot
        backend work better.

        I checked it out and this did not fix the problem and actually caused
        some

        rather hilarious bouncing in graphs with regular cycles.

        You can see this bouncing if you run the following lines from the
        Tutorials:


        http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics


        ```

        rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

        rostopic pub /turtle1/command_velocity turtlesim/Velocity -r 1 -- 2.0 
        -1.8

        rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot --args /turtle1/pose/x:y

        ```


        This could probably be avoided if we ensured the currently view-able
        graph was considered in the bound limits.

        Also I have some new information on the original bug. 


        If you pause the plot and then unpause it the time you had it paused
        will show up in the graph as a perfectly smooth graph and then the
        plotter will start to draw incorrectly again.

        an aside: What is preventing us from depending directly on one of the
        other 2 plotting libraries and using those as the default?

        The problem is that the matplot function is taking longer and longer and
        therefore block reading the incoming data. This is also the reason why
        "pause" make the curves perfectly smooth again.


        I have update the code to not use collections for the data but simple
        list (which turns out to scale better), perform the calculation of the
        min/max y values when adding values (instead of repeatedly when drawing
        going over all/parts of the data).


        It scales much better now but the inherent problem is not fixed - the
        data will always accumulate over time. We could either limit the history
        or add a manual clean option if we want this to be fixed completely.

        The original ticket was closed because it was not an rqt issue it was an
        rqt_plot (rqt_common_plugins) issue.


        This is still an outstanding rqt_plot issue.

        This would be solved if we were to put the pyqt deb into the ROS deb
        repos as discussed here:
        https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/103


        I've started talking to Tully to make sure this can happen.

        From the screenshots it looks like rxplot also has this problem (maybe
        not as strong), is that correct?

        Then I would guess this has something to do with the MatPlot backend.

        Could you try to reproduce this with the PyQtGraph and QwtPlot backends?

        Yes it happens on rxplot too but it does seem more pronounced on the rqt
        version.

        I will try to reproduce on the other plotters today.

        Tested QwtPlot and it doesn't seem to happen (so far I will continue
        running this to be sure)


        After fixing a bug in pyqtgraph in
        pyqtgraph/graphicsItems/PlotItem/PlotItem.py:


        ```
                if name is not None and self.legend is not None:
        ->
                if name is not None and hasattr(self, 'legend') and self.legend is not None:
        ```


        It also doesn't seem to happen.

        It looks pretty clear that this is a MatPlot bug.


        Perhaps we should depend on one of the other packages and make it the
        default?

        Just to note it gets really bad and really slow after awhile of running.
        I talked with some people here and they mentioned this slowness has been
        an issue in rxplot for some time.

        I had a quick look at the MatPlot backend code which someone ported form
        rxplot and it looks like the calculation of the axes bounds might be the
        problem, as it calculates the min and max y values over the complete
        data sequence...

        I made a quick change to only use the last 100 data points, which should
        prevent this from happening.

        Could you check if this was the reason and if it looks better now?

        Still this is just a dirty hack and I think we should rather depend on
        the PyQtGraph library, but it is not the Ubuntu package repos...

        Otherwise someone has to take a deeper look into making the MatPlot
        backend work better.

        I checked it out and this did not fix the problem and actually caused
        some

        rather hilarious bouncing in graphs with regular cycles.

        You can see this bouncing if you run the following lines from the
        Tutorials:


        http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics


        ```

        rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

        rostopic pub /turtle1/command_velocity turtlesim/Velocity -r 1 -- 2.0 
        -1.8

        rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot --args /turtle1/pose/x:y

        ```


        This could probably be avoided if we ensured the currently view-able
        graph was considered in the bound limits.

        Also I have some new information on the original bug. 


        If you pause the plot and then unpause it the time you had it paused
        will show up in the graph as a perfectly smooth graph and then the
        plotter will start to draw incorrectly again.

        an aside: What is preventing us from depending directly on one of the
        other 2 plotting libraries and using those as the default?

        The problem is that the matplot function is taking longer and longer and
        therefore block reading the incoming data. This is also the reason why
        "pause" make the curves perfectly smooth again.


        I have update the code to not use collections for the data but simple
        list (which turns out to scale better), perform the calculation of the
        min/max y values when adding values (instead of repeatedly when drawing
        going over all/parts of the data).


        It scales much better now but the inherent problem is not fixed - the
        data will always accumulate over time. We could either limit the history
        or add a manual clean option if we want this to be fixed completely.

        The original ticket was closed because it was not an rqt issue it was an
        rqt_plot (rqt_common_plugins) issue.


        This is still an outstanding rqt_plot issue.

        This would be solved if we were to put the pyqt deb into the ROS deb
        repos as discussed here:
        https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/103


        I've started talking to Tully to make sure this can happen.

    steps to duplicate

    execute the UnderstandingTopics tutorial
    (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics)

    leave the rqt_plot open for an extended period of time.

    You will see the following:

        From the screenshots it looks like rxplot also has this problem (maybe
        not as strong), is that correct?

        Then I would guess this has something to do with the MatPlot backend.

        Could you try to reproduce this with the PyQtGraph and QwtPlot backends?

        Yes it happens on rxplot too but it does seem more pronounced on the rqt
        version.

        I will try to reproduce on the other plotters today.

        Tested QwtPlot and it doesn't seem to happen (so far I will continue
        running this to be sure)


        After fixing a bug in pyqtgraph in
        pyqtgraph/graphicsItems/PlotItem/PlotItem.py:


        ```
                if name is not None and self.legend is not None:
        ->
                if name is not None and hasattr(self, 'legend') and self.legend is not None:
        ```


        It also doesn't seem to happen.

        It looks pretty clear that this is a MatPlot bug.


        Perhaps we should depend on one of the other packages and make it the
        default?

        Just to note it gets really bad and really slow after awhile of running.
        I talked with some people here and they mentioned this slowness has been
        an issue in rxplot for some time.

        I had a quick look at the MatPlot backend code which someone ported form
        rxplot and it looks like the calculation of the axes bounds might be the
        problem, as it calculates the min and max y values over the complete
        data sequence...

        I made a quick change to only use the last 100 data points, which should
        prevent this from happening.

        Could you check if this was the reason and if it looks better now?

        Still this is just a dirty hack and I think we should rather depend on
        the PyQtGraph library, but it is not the Ubuntu package repos...

        Otherwise someone has to take a deeper look into making the MatPlot
        backend work better.

        I checked it out and this did not fix the problem and actually caused
        some

        rather hilarious bouncing in graphs with regular cycles.

        You can see this bouncing if you run the following lines from the
        Tutorials:


        http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics


        ```

        rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

        rostopic pub /turtle1/command_velocity turtlesim/Velocity -r 1 -- 2.0 
        -1.8

        rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot --args /turtle1/pose/x:y

        ```


        This could probably be avoided if we ensured the currently view-able
        graph was considered in the bound limits.

        Also I have some new information on the original bug. 


        If you pause the plot and then unpause it the time you had it paused
        will show up in the graph as a perfectly smooth graph and then the
        plotter will start to draw incorrectly again.

        an aside: What is preventing us from depending directly on one of the
        other 2 plotting libraries and using those as the default?

        The problem is that the matplot function is taking longer and longer and
        therefore block reading the incoming data. This is also the reason why
        "pause" make the curves perfectly smooth again.


        I have update the code to not use collections for the data but simple
        list (which turns out to scale better), perform the calculation of the
        min/max y values when adding values (instead of repeatedly when drawing
        going over all/parts of the data).


        It scales much better now but the inherent problem is not fixed - the
        data will always accumulate over time. We could either limit the history
        or add a manual clean option if we want this to be fixed completely.

        This issue has not been addressed to my knowledge. We should leave one
        or both of these tickets open to track this in my opinion.

        The original ticket was closed because it was not an rqt issue it was an
        rqt_plot (rqt_common_plugins) issue.


        This is still an outstanding rqt_plot issue.

        This would be solved if we were to put the pyqt deb into the ROS deb
        repos as discussed here:
        https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/103


        I've started talking to Tully to make sure this can happen.

    steps to duplicate

    execute the UnderstandingTopics tutorial
    (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics)

    leave the rqt_plot open for an extended period of time.

    You will see the following:

        From the screenshots it looks like rxplot also has this problem (maybe
        not as strong), is that correct?

        Then I would guess this has something to do with the MatPlot backend.

        Could you try to reproduce this with the PyQtGraph and QwtPlot backends?
        (selectable form the settings menu)

        Yes it happens on rxplot too but it does seem more pronounced on the rqt
        version.

        I will try to reproduce on the other plotters today.

        Tested QwtPlot and it doesn't seem to happen (so far I will continue
        running this to be sure)


        After fixing a bug in pyqtgraph in
        pyqtgraph/graphicsItems/PlotItem/PlotItem.py:


        ```
                if name is not None and self.legend is not None:
        ->
                if name is not None and hasattr(self, 'legend') and self.legend is not None:
        ```


        It also doesn't seem to happen.

        It looks pretty clear that this is a MatPlot bug.


        Perhaps we should depend on one of the other packages and make it the
        default?

        Just to note it gets really bad and really slow after awhile of running.
        I talked with some people here and they mentioned this slowness has been
        an issue in rxplot for some time.

        I had a quick look at the MatPlot backend code which someone ported form
        rxplot and it looks like the calculation of the axes bounds might be the
        problem, as it calculates the min and max y values over the complete
        data sequence...

        I made a quick change to only use the last 100 data points, which should
        prevent this from happening.

        Could you check if this was the reason and if it looks better now?

        Still this is just a dirty hack and I think we should rather depend on
        the PyQtGraph library, but it is not the Ubuntu package repos...

        Otherwise someone has to take a deeper look into making the MatPlot
        backend work better.

        I checked it out and this did not fix the problem and actually caused
        some

        rather hilarious bouncing in graphs with regular cycles.

        You can see this bouncing if you run the following lines from the
        Tutorials:


        http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics


        ```

        rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

        rostopic pub /turtle1/command_velocity turtlesim/Velocity -r 1 -- 2.0 
        -1.8

        rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot --args /turtle1/pose/x:y

        ```


        This could probably be avoided if we ensured the currently view-able
        graph was considered in the bound limits.

        Also I have some new information on the original bug. 


        If you pause the plot and then unpause it the time you had it paused
        will show up in the graph as a perfectly smooth graph and then the
        plotter will start to draw incorrectly again.

        The problem is that the matplot function is taking longer and longer and
        therefore block reading the incoming data. This is also the reason why
        "pause" make the curves perfectly smooth again.


        I have update the code to not use collections for the data but simple
        list (which turns out to scale better), perform the calculation of the
        min/max y values when adding values (instead of repeatedly when drawing
        going over all/parts of the data).


        It scales much better now but the inherent problem is not fixed - the
        data will always accumulate over time. We could either limit the history
        or add a manual clean option if we want this to be fixed completely.

        This issue has not been addressed to my knowledge. We should leave one
        or both of these tickets open to track this in my opinion.

        The original ticket was closed because it was not an rqt issue it was an
        rqt_plot (rqt_common_plugins) issue.


        This is still an outstanding rqt_plot issue.

        This would be solved if we were to put the pyqt deb into the ROS deb
        repos as discussed here:
        https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/103


        I've started talking to Tully to make sure this can happen.

    - [x] left column takes all the space, right column has only minimum width,
    should be the other way around

    - [x] the configuration block per node and vertically spread, should have
    spacing at the bottom

    - [x] each edit row is horizontally spread, should make use of the full
    width instead

    - [ ] the row label is overlapping with the controls when the window is
    small

    While running rqt_robot_monitor I get a continuous stream of the following
    in the parent terminal:


    ```

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline_view.py", line 194, in _slot_redraw
        for i, m in enumerate(self._timeline):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline.p  y", line 158, in __iter__
        for msg in self._queue:
    RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration

    ```


    Looks like the timeline queue is being modified by the ROS message callback
    in the `Timeline` class while at the same time being iterated over by
    `TimelineView`. I'm not what a good fix is, but I'm guessing this is causing
    more than just annoying error messages because I also see frequent
    rqt_robot_monitor freezes and crashes - most often when using the inspector
    window.

        Yes it looks like the issue is that a message is coming in while screen
        is being redrawn. Since a message coming in triggers a redraw if the
        messages get pumped out fast enough this is going to happen often.


        I think the solution to this is to cache all incoming messages in the
        callback and them process them at a regular rate. This way the redraw
        rate is fairly fixed. User interaction will generate redraws also so to
        be extra safe it would be wise to mutex the redraw and "cache process"
        code.


        I probably won't be able to code this up until next year unfortunately.

I actually watched your presentation from last year's ROSCon about the build farm and it took some time to read through everything. Since this was my first release I tried to be careful to not breaking things. But everything worked out well now. Using bloom makes everything really easy :)\r\nBTW: could you add me please as a collaborator for the rqt_moveit package so I can maintain that by myself as well?"

    While running rqt_robot_monitor I get a continuous stream of the following
    in the parent terminal:


    ```

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline_view.py", line 194, in _slot_redraw
        for i, m in enumerate(self._timeline):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline.p  y", line 158, in __iter__
        for msg in self._queue:
    RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration

    ```


    Looks like the timeline queue is being modified by the ROS message callback
    in the `Timeline` class while at the same time being iterated over by
    `TimelineView`. I'm not what a good fix is, but I'm guessing this is causing
    more than just annoying error messages because I also see frequent
    rqt_robot_monitor freezes and crashes - most often when using the inspector
    window.

        Yes it looks like the issue is that a message is coming in while screen
        is being redrawn. Since a message coming in triggers a redraw if the
        messages get pumped out fast enough this is going to happen often.


        I think the solution to this is to cache all incoming messages in the
        callback and them process them at a regular rate. This way the redraw
        rate is fairly fixed. User interaction will generate redraws also so to
        be extra safe it would be wise to mutex the redraw and "cache process"
        code.


        I probably won't be able to code this up until next year unfortunately.

        I just noticed that you tagged a new release (0.5.8) :+1: You will still
        need to release this new version into the various ROS distros using
        `bloom` to make them available to users.

    While running rqt_robot_monitor I get a continuous stream of the following
    in the parent terminal:


    ```

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline_view.py", line 194, in _slot_redraw
        for i, m in enumerate(self._timeline):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline.p  y", line 158, in __iter__
        for msg in self._queue:
    RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration

    ```


    Looks like the timeline queue is being modified by the ROS message callback
    in the `Timeline` class while at the same time being iterated over by
    `TimelineView`. I'm not what a good fix is, but I'm guessing this is causing
    more than just annoying error messages because I also see frequent
    rqt_robot_monitor freezes and crashes - most often when using the inspector
    window.

        Yes it looks like the issue is that a message is coming in while screen
        is being redrawn. Since a message coming in triggers a redraw if the
        messages get pumped out fast enough this is going to happen often.


        I think the solution to this is to cache all incoming messages in the
        callback and them process them at a regular rate. This way the redraw
        rate is fairly fixed. User interaction will generate redraws also so to
        be extra safe it would be wise to mutex the redraw and "cache process"
        code.


        I probably won't be able to code this up until next year unfortunately.

        Didn't get a chance to look at this before Christmas vacation. Will be
        looking at it next week.

        need to release this new version into the various ROS distros using

    While running rqt_robot_monitor I get a continuous stream of the following
    in the parent terminal:


    ```

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline_view.py", line 194, in _slot_redraw
        for i, m in enumerate(self._timeline):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline.p  y", line 158, in __iter__
        for msg in self._queue:
    RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration

    ```


    Looks like the timeline queue is being modified by the ROS message callback
    in the `Timeline` class while at the same time being iterated over by
    `TimelineView`. I'm not what a good fix is, but I'm guessing this is causing
    more than just annoying error messages because I also see frequent
    rqt_robot_monitor freezes and crashes - most often when using the inspector
    window.

        Yes it looks like the issue is that a message is coming in while screen
        is being redrawn. Since a message coming in triggers a redraw if the
        messages get pumped out fast enough this is going to happen often.


        I think the solution to this is to cache all incoming messages in the
        callback and them process them at a regular rate. This way the redraw
        rate is fairly fixed. User interaction will generate redraws also so to
        be extra safe it would be wise to mutex the redraw and "cache process"
        code.


        I probably won't be able to code this up until next year unfortunately.

        I just noticed that you tagged a new release (0.5.8) :+1: You will still
        need to release this new version into the various ROS distros using
        `bloom` to make them available to users.

I actually watched your presentation from last year's ROSCon about the build farm and it took some time to read through everything. Since this was my first release I tried to be careful to not breaking things. But everything worked out well now. Using bloom makes everything really easy :)\r\nBTW: could you add me please as a collaborator for the rqt_moveit package so I can maintain that by myself as well?"

    While running rqt_robot_monitor I get a continuous stream of the following
    in the parent terminal:


    ```

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline_view.py", line 194, in _slot_redraw
        for i, m in enumerate(self._timeline):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline.p  y", line 158, in __iter__
        for msg in self._queue:
    RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration

    ```


    Looks like the timeline queue is being modified by the ROS message callback
    in the `Timeline` class while at the same time being iterated over by
    `TimelineView`. I'm not what a good fix is, but I'm guessing this is causing
    more than just annoying error messages because I also see frequent
    rqt_robot_monitor freezes and crashes - most often when using the inspector
    window.

        Yes it looks like the issue is that a message is coming in while screen
        is being redrawn. Since a message coming in triggers a redraw if the
        messages get pumped out fast enough this is going to happen often.


        I think the solution to this is to cache all incoming messages in the
        callback and them process them at a regular rate. This way the redraw
        rate is fairly fixed. User interaction will generate redraws also so to
        be extra safe it would be wise to mutex the redraw and "cache process"
        code.


        I probably won't be able to code this up until next year unfortunately.

      body: "@dirk-thomas Thank you for giving me hints that is really helpful because I am quite new to the whole ROS distribution system. I actually watched your presentation from last year's ROSCon about the build farm and it took some time to read through everything. Since this was my first release I tried to be careful to not breaking things. But everything worked out well now. Using bloom makes everything really easy :)\r\nBTW: could you add me please as a collaborator for the rqt_moveit package so I can maintain that by myself as well?"

        The knowledge that nothing has been received seems like rather important
        information. This could alert the user to a connection issues that could
        be serious and that they shouldn't trust the robot_monitor info anymore.

        This should be a rather simple addition of a timer/color change. I will

        I think the runtime monitor marks entries as stale when it does not
        receive new data for a while. It simply does not know that the data is
        coming from a bag file and the user has decided to pause playback.

    We should do the same as with the depth image, don't filter the scan before
    doing ray tracing, but if Grid/RangeMax is set, limit the range of the rays
    to it. For example, right know if Grid/RangeMax is 4 and an obstacle is
    detected at 5 meters, no ray tracing happens. The new approach should ray
    trace up to 4 meters in direction of the detected obstacle.

  body: "When the laser scanner is mounted upside down, the empty space is not filled in the good direction. **For now in that case, \"map_negative_poses_ignored\" should be set to true.**\r\n\r\nIn the code, we assume that the first scan is -y and the last is on +y so that it rotates clockwise from -y, +x, +y value.\r\n\r\nWhen set upside down, the first scan is +y and the last one on -y, and unknown space should be filled counter clockwise +y, +x, -y.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the smallest y was detected (begin or end of the scans array) to rotate in the right direction. See [here](https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/blob/152d47e62af3c19f9d3cc2f26cd15651351a372b/corelib/src/util3d_mapping.cpp#L490-L496). However, this approach is not robust as in some cases the first value may be larger than the last one even if the laser is mounted normally, so creating the bug for why this code is now commented."

    When I start Nav View and then start Standalone Visualizer, only the display
    for Nav View will appear. Immediately after I close the Nav View display,
    however, the display for Standalone Visualizer will appear. I can also
    produce the same effect in the reverse order by starting Standalone
    Visualizer first and then Nav View. Not sure why these tools can't run in
    parallel, but its probably worth looking into.

    This is running on Ubuntu 8.10.  The problem also occurs if the
    system-installed Ogre is used.

    image_view crashes when run on the head_cart (through shh -X from a laptop
    connected to the switch). It gives this message:


    thibaux@hcb2:~$ rosrun image_view  image_view
    image:=narrow_stereo/left/image_color

    [ INFO] 1247593236.750450000: Started node
    [/image_view_1247593236743871000], pid [21269], bound on [hcb2], xmlrpc port

    [/u/thibaux/ros/ros/log/image_view_1247593236743871000_21269.log], using
    [real] time

    The program 'image_color' received an X Window System error.

    This probably reflects a bug in the program.

    The error was 'BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)'.
      (Details: serial 190 error_code 2 request_code 147 minor_code 3)
      (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
       that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
       To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
       option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
       backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

    segfaults when quitting.

  body: "Hi,\n\nI noticed a bug in rviz that causes a non-deterministic crash. It occurs only when displaying the tf tree and when the tf tree is broken, i.e. it has two roots (here base_footprint and map). According to gdb, it is a segfault in wxpropgrid. Attached you find a launch file and an rviz config that starts up rviz, gazebo, the map_server and some controllers. After some time (it can take up to several minutes) rviz dies with the following error:\n{{{\nrviz: /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros/../local/lenny-amd64/include/boost-1_37/boost/thread/pthread/mutex.hpp:50: void boost::mutex::lock(): Assertion `!pthread_mutex_lock(&m)' failed.\n(0) : fatal error C9999: *** exception during compilation ***\nCg compiler terminated due to fatal error\n}}}\n\nThe gdb output is:\n{{{\n\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n[Switching to Thread 0x7f34de4997a0 (LWP 31246)]\nwxPropertyGridInterface::DeleteProperty (this=0x1a0d9c0, id=<value optimized out>) at ./include/wx/propgrid/propgrid.h:4316\n4316\t    wxPropertyGrid* GetGrid() const { return m_pPropGrid; }\n(gdb) where\n#0  wxPropertyGridInterface::DeleteProperty (this=0x1a0d9c0, id=<value optimized out>) at ./include/wx/propgrid/propgrid.h:4316\n#1  0x00007f34da83fc1c in ~PropertyBase (this=0x38cd0b0) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros-pkg/visualization/rviz/src/rviz/properties/property.cpp:64\n#2  0x00007f34da845feb in ~Property (this=0x38cd0b0) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros-pkg/visualization/rviz/src/rviz/properties/property.h:157\n#3  0x00007f34da8461a7 in ~CategoryProperty (this=0x38cd0b0) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros-pkg/visualization/rviz/src/rviz/properties/property.h:399\n#4  0x00007f34da84c68a in boost::checked_delete<rviz::CategoryProperty> (x=0x38cd0b0) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros/../local/lenny-amd64/include/boost-1_37/boost/checked_delete.hpp:34\n#5  0x00007f34da84da4f in boost::detail::sp_counted_impl_p<rviz::CategoryProperty>::dispose (this=0x3f4c960)\n    at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros/../local/lenny-amd64/include/boost-1_37/boost/detail/sp_counted_impl.hpp:78\n#6  0x0000000000417522 in boost::detail::sp_counted_base::release (this=0x3f4c960)\n    at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros/../local/lenny-amd64/include/boost-1_37/boost/detail/sp_counted_base_gcc_x86.hpp:145\n#7  0x0000000000417568 in ~shared_count (this=0x7fffe66000f8) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros/../local/lenny-amd64/include/boost-1_37/boost/detail/shared_count.hpp:216\n#8  0x00007f34da840bb7 in ~shared_ptr (this=0x7fffe66000f0) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros/../local/lenny-amd64/include/boost-1_37/boost/shared_ptr.hpp:165\n#9  0x00007f34c5aa0435 in rviz::TFDisplay::updateFrame (this=0x1ef4600, frame=0x2577690) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros-pkg/visualization/rviz/src/default_plugin/tf_display.cpp:554\n#10 0x00007f34c5aa4335 in rviz::TFDisplay::updateFrames (this=0x1ef4600) at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros-pkg/visualization/rviz/src/default_plugin/tf_display.cpp:376\n#11 0x00007f34c5aa462b in rviz::TFDisplay::update (this=0x1ef4600, wall_dt=0.0328929983, ros_dt=0.0120000001)\n    at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros-pkg/visualization/rviz/src/default_plugin/tf_display.cpp:332\n#12 0x00007f34da882cc2 in rviz::VisualizationManager::onUpdate (this=0x7f34c002adb0, event=@0x7fffe66008c0)\n    at /usr/wiss/moesenle/work/ros/ros-pkg/visualization/rviz/src/rviz/visualization_manager.cpp:309\n#13 0x00007f34d8a36349 in wxEvtHandler::ProcessEventIfMatches () from /usr/lib/libwx_baseu-2.8.so.0\n#14 0x00007f34d8a364f4 in wxEvtHandler::SearchDynamicEventTable () from /usr/lib/libwx_baseu-2.8.so.0\n#15 0x00007f34d8a375d2 in wxEvtHandler::ProcessEvent () from /usr/lib/libwx_baseu-2.8.so.0\n#16 0x00007f34d93da726 in wxTimerBase::Notify () from /usr/lib/libwx_gtk2u_core-2.8.so.0\n#17 0x00007f34d92e260b in ??

    Running rviz in OS X, I get a pop-up that reads:


    wxWidgets Debug Alert


    {{{

    ./src/propgrid.cpp(7132): assert "width >= 0" failed in SetVirtualWidth().

    Do you want to stop the program?

    You can also choose [Cancel] to suppress further warnings.

    }}}


    Clicking "No" repeats the popup.  Clicking "No" for the second time results
    in a:

    {{{

    (0) : fatal error C9999: *** exception during compilation ***

    Cg compiler terminated due to fatal errorAssertion failed:
    (!pthread_mutex_lock(&m)), function lock, file

    (0) : fatal error C9999: *** exception during compilation ***

    Cg compiler terminated due to fatal error

    }}}


    Clicking "Yes" leads to:

    {{{

    The application rviz quit unexpectedly."

    }}}


    Clicking "Cancel" leads to a mostly working rviz, though missing the
    toolbar.

    The library (libmotion_planning_rviz_plugin.so) certainly exists, and both
    it and rviz were just rebuilt.

    rviz has several problems that need to be addressed:


    1) it fails when listening to an Image topic when using dcam1394 (not for
    dcam or cameradc1394).  I'm assuming this is due to image_transport
    incompatibilities.


    Error message: 

    {{{

    rviz: ../../OgreMain/include/OgreAxisAlignedBox.h:246: void
    Ogre::AxisAlignedBox::setExtents(const Ogre::Vector3&, const
    Ogre::Vector3&): Assertion `(min.x <= max.x && min.y <= max.y && min.z <=
    max.z) && "The minimum corner of the box must be less than or equal to
    maximum corner"' failed.

    Cg compiler terminated due to fatal error

    }}}


    2) The Bayer RGGB and BGGR filters from cameradc1394 are not displayed
    properly (lots of lines in the image).  The GBRG and GRBG look better but
    are swapped (GBRG filter displays using GRBG).


    3) Changing the base frame causes segfaults if rviz is listening to a topic.

    I am running off of trunk.


    I was using the dynamic_reconfigure tool for the laser scanner and rviz
    crashed with this error, I don't know if this is a bug or just what is
    supposed to happen but here is the error:

    Rviz froze up soon after I attempted to set a map goal (I'm not sure they're
    related, though).


    At the time, my TF tree was also behaving strangely, which may have
    contributed to this.  The validity of the transforms in the tree was
    flickering on and off rapidly - sometimes tf thought it had two disconnected
    trees, and sometimes it thought it was fine.


    Output below:

    I turned rviz on to decay after 200 seconds of laser data.  Everything
    worked fine until I tried to drop the decay time to 2 seconds.  At that time
    rviz entirely stopped responding.  



    It froze for about 20 seconds.  I tried it once and force killed it.  Then
    tried it again and waited.  


    It's frozen enough to not respond to clicks, and the window manager prompts
    the "Force Quit" dialog when the X is pressed.

    If I start up rviz with no displays and add a static map, it starts off
    invisible by default, as the initial view is parallel to the xy-plane.  
    Might be a better default to not be parallel to any axis.

    I was using rviz, r29201, on the qual machines, and I've seen several
    reports of crashes. Techs have reported that the program will work sometimes
    and not other. I'm reverting back to r28337 in the meantime.


    I used both the "visual verifier" and rviz.

    I got RVIZ (cturtle A3) to crash on me at an assertion. I was viewing my USB
    camera feed with transport hint raw, and I selected another one just to see.
    I got this:

    failed.


    Trying to restart RVIZ after gives me this:

    The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.

    This probably reflects a bug in the program.

    The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'.

    I tried with compressed and theora, and they both make it crash if the
    provider sends raw data.

    We've been running rviz on this test machine before. As far as I know, I
    haven't changed the graphics driver or configuration. 


    I ran the visualizer, and got this error:

    Then I tried running rviz, and it repeatedly segfaulted. I upgraded to ROS
    1.1.12. Before the upgrade, everything worked (I think).

    visualization: 1.1.2

    visualization_common: 1.1.2


    I got it to drop a core, here's the back trace:

    On two of our lab computers that run Ubuntu 9.10 and ros 1.1.14, we have
    trouble starting rviz and keep getting the following error:


    If we keep trying 'rosrun rviz rviz', eventually the error goes away. But it
    is very random and time consuming. We also googled the problem, and
    downgraded xorg-core, but it didn't fix the problem...


    The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error. 

    This probably reflects a bug in the program. 

    The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'. 

    (Details: serial 22 error_code 9 request_code 136 minor_code 3) 

    (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously; 

    that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it. 

    To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line 

    option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful 

    backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


    Attached is our .rviz folder. Thanks for your help!

    http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/rxbag-Exception-when-viewing-bag-files-with-sensor-msgs-Image-topics-td1442925.html)


    When playing around with the ccny's Augmented Reality demos I viewed one of
    their provided bag files in rxbag and I received this exception:


    {{{

    Error loading image on topic /usb_cam/image_raw: buffer is not long enough

    Exception in thread Thread-1:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/threading.py", line 532, in __bootstrap_inner

        return cairo.ImageSurface.create_for_data(data, cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, w, h)
    TypeError: buffer is not long enough

    }}}


    It seems to me that problem is to do with how the images are being loaded
    into cairo, or are a limitation of cario.


    My system:

    {{{

    Guest Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04 on a Host OS X Laptop:

    CTurtle binary install 1.2.x

    libcairo2-dev version 1.8.10-2ubuntu1

    }}}


    Steps to reproduce:
     1. Get the bag files for the ccny ar_pose demo, instructions: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ar_pose
     2. roscd ar_pose/demo
     3. rxbag usb_cam_topics_ar_multi.bag
     4. Enable thumbnails
    Or
     5. View the "Image" of an Image topic
     6. The images will not appear and the exception will be in the terminal where rxbag was launched from.

    rviz 1.3.1 from debian


    I'm not sure if you've seen this before or if it's helpful.  But i'm seeing
    this reliably on my laptop.  It's an nvidia card on lucid with the nvidia
    260 series drivers

    RViz reliably segfaults when removing a camera display. Steps to reproduce:


    1. Launch up and view the rgb/image_color topic from a Kinect (followed
    steps here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ni) (prolly works with any camera
    though)


    2. Close the camera display window


    3. Remove the camera display from the display list (but do not uncheck it
    first)


    4. RViz segfaults.


    My guess would be that RViz tries to close the Camera window when I remove
    the display, but the camera window is already gone. Hence the segfault.


    Backtrace (patched version including ticket 4610, but otherwise should be
    most recent trunk):


    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

    Currently, the I.M. server sends an INIT message using a
    SingleSubscriberPublisher each time a client connects (it gets a callback
    from roscpp when this happens). However, other messages from the server may
    arrive at the client (rviz) before the actual init message due to the way
    roscpp works. This probably occurs because the callback the server gets on a
    connect is pushed onto the global callback queue, and there might be pending
    callbacks executed before it, in which the server will send messages. The
    client will get these first.


    Also, the way the protocol works is a big problem for wviz (Bosch’s web
    browser rviz), because it runs behind a node that is always subscribed to
    the server’s topic. It will never get an INIT message then. Jihoon (intern
    at Bosch) has urgently requested that to be changed. There might be another
    possible workaround, but given the fact that the solution I designed doesn’t
    work nicely anyway doesn’t make it seem a good option to require them to
    write some hackish workaround.


    Proposed solution: Make the INIT message a service call which the client
    actively calls. This would work like this on the client side:

    subscribe to update topic

    call init service in concurrent thread

    save all incoming update messages

    when the service call finishes, keep all update messages received so far
    with a higher sequence number than the init message, discard the others.

  body: >-
    I've been working with a system that uses a robot_state_publisher to publish
    tf to rviz, where the robot_state_publisher consumes the joint state
    messages produced by the planning_components_visualizer.  The latter piece
    of code was running in such a way that it only published joint state messes
    when the user changed the state of the robot.  If the user wasn't actively
    interacting with the program for a while I noticed that the rviz window
    would lock up - go blank if put behind something, require a SIGTERM to
    exit.  I began looking into why this happened and settled on the RobotModel
    display type as the culprit - if enabled, the system eventually hangs, and
    if disabled (or just unchecked) the program never locks up.  If you uncheck
    the robot model, wait 3 minutes, and check it rviz will instantly lock up. 
    I also figured out that what was special about my system is the fact that it
    publishes some joint state messages and then stops.  The
    robot_state_publisher will continue to publish tf transforms, but only for
    fixed transforms, not for any actual non-fixed joints.  It seems like this
    combination of things is the problem - if you simply bring down the robot
    state publisher all together rviz is fine.  Which is also ok - shouldn't it
    start complaining at some point when it hasn't gotten tf?


    The attached package demonstrates the buggy behavior - overlay on the
    shadow-fixed version of unstable, make it, and 'roslaunch rviz_weird_test
    rviz_weird_test.launch'.  This will bring up rviz with a RobotModel, a
    robot_state_publisher, and a joint state publisher that will stop publishing
    after 10 seconds.  Rviz will lock up after approximately 160 total seconds
    of walltime.

        [hersh] This is looking like a lot of trouble to debug.  Gil says it is
        not blocking him (he has a workaround) and that in normal usage it
        doesn't come up at all.


        I would like to understand it at some point to make sure TF etc don't
        have a subtle bug.  For now I am lowering the priority.

    rviz crashes reproducibly when it receives a TRIANGLE_LIST marker twice with
    action ''ADD'' and empty ''points'' and ''colors'' vectors.


    Attached is a backtrace, the used rviz configuration and the marker-of-death
    in a bag file.


    I was using the Debian packages for diamondback.


    The crash happened on an AMD Turion(tm) 64 notebook with an nVidia G72M
    (!GeForce Go 7300) and Ubuntu 11.04. I also tested it on my Desktop, an
    Intel i7 with an nVidia !GeForce GT240 AMP and Ubuntu 10.10. It crashed as
    well.


    The backtrace:

    Due to needing Cocoa support on OS X, the wx version needs to be pushed to
    wx-2.9.2.  This version includes wxPropgrid in it by default, rather than a
    stand-alone library like wx-2.8.  In addition to integrating wxPropgrid into
    the core of wxWidgets they changed the API.


    I am creating this ticket as a reference for all patches to fix
    discrepancies between the old wxPropgrid API and the new one.


    There are numerous compile time errors, a few (non-fatal) run time
    exceptions, and some undesired behaviors related to this API change that
    need to be addressed.


    I will be posting patches for review to this ticket, and referencing this
    ticket in the comments around the patches for traceability.

    Sensor data such as pointcloud2 and laser scans cannot be rotated in the
    rviz display window.  I used a hokuyo urg-04lx laser scanner, with the
    hokuyo_node package and openni_kinect with a kinect for the pointcloud2
    sensor data input.  


    I started a roscore, launched a simple transform for the laser (0,0,0,0,0,0
    base_link to laser), ran a hokuyo_node, and ran rviz.


    I added a grid and tf and scan objects into rviz.  The two attached pictures
    are of two different angles viewing in rviz.  As you can see, the laser data
    does not change orientation with the grid from looking from top down
    (perpendicular to the grid), to nearly parallel with the grid.


    I first noticed this with the pointcloud2 data I was trying to look at in
    rviz.


    This problem occurred after a fresh clean install of 11.04 64 bit ubuntu
    with a fresh clean install of ros-diamondback via apt-get.  


    I'm running a 27 inch iMac, Fall 2010 model, with an i7 processor and a ATI
    Radeon 6900M graphics card.


    I have also attached the ogre log file.

    In electric, rviz becomes completely unresponsive while visualizing arround
    180 tf transforms. 


    Nothing else is visualized except TF and RobotModel. The TF topic publishing
    frequency is not high, at arround 6 Hz. Without visualizing the TF tree
    everything works fine.


    Also, the same model and setup works in the diamondback rviz.

        [mihai.dolha] Hi,


        thanks, for your reply.


        I can confirm that changing the update interval makes rviz more
        responsive (i tried it on 1.6.3). still it's strange as this used to
        work fine in the diamondback rviz.

        [dgossow] I've been looking into this problem and one thing I've found
        is that RViz will usually stall for some time when deactivating a TF
        display, which does not help when that TF hoses RViz anyway. What I've
        found is the reason is that deleting the properties for each tf frame
        indiviually takes a long time, as some global operations on the whole
        grid are performed during that.


        I've attached a patch that deletes all properties at once, which makes
        deactivating a tf display a lot faster.

        [dgossow] OK, I think I've finally found the problem and was able to
        reliably reproduce the behaviour by hosing RViz with around 1000 tf
        transforms.


        In the current version, visualization_manager has two wx callbacks:

         * onUpdate() gets called by a timer at 60 Hz. It calls ros:spinOnce(), triggering all non-threaded message callbacks, and all onUpdate() functions of tools, displays etc. It also calls wxWakeUpIdle(), which fires an Idle event.
         * onIdle gets called on Idle events and updates the OpenGL/Ogre window.

        What happens when RViz becomes unresponsive is the following:


        The message processing in onUpdate is very computationally expensive,
        e.g. lots of tf frames -> lots of updates in Ogre and the Property grid,
        which I found makes a big part of RViz' cpu time. That results in
        onUpdate blocking all other event processing, first freezing the OpenGL
        display and, on very high CPU load, preventing RViz to process user
        input etc. In that situation, you would see onUpdate getting called with
        a very stable frequency, while everything else halts.


        This is probably the reason why Josh moved the rendering into onIdle in
        r28714. He might not have anticipated that messages processing could be
        so expensive that it will brick RViz as well.


        This is how to fix the problem (patch will follow):
         * Make onUpdate() only call wxWakeUpIdle
         * Move everything else from onUpdate() to onIdle()

        This works very nicely on my computer.


        Note: if you compare the old vs. new RViz, make sure that RViz actually
        loads the right librviz.so shared lib. That's where the code gets
        compiled into.

    After I upgraded from diamondback to electric I am getting a segfault when I
    am trying to run rviz with "rosrun rviz rviz"


    I am on rviz 1.6.4

    ogre_tools revision number 1.6.2

    compiled against OGRE version 1.7.3 (Cthugha)


    The error looks like

    "[ INFO] [1317363614.470886019]: Loading display config from
    [/home/turtlebot/.rviz/display_config]

    [ INFO] [1317363614.509718178]: RTT Preferred Mode is PBuffer.

    The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.

    This probably reflects a bug in the program.

    The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'."


    I will attach this as a text file to the ticket to make it a bit more
    readable. 

    backtrace from gdb is as follows:

    rviz crashes when used with large OccupancyGridMaps. The particular case I
    debugged had a map with resolution 2781 x 6531. When loading the map, rviz
    shuts down without mentioning any reason:


    {{{

    }}}


    I located the problem in the method MapDisplay::load(). First, rviz shuts
    down because of an unhandled exception thrown by

    {{{

    texture_ = Ogre::TextureManager::getSingleton().loadImage(ss.str(),
    Ogre::ResourceGroupManager::DEFAULT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, image);

    }}}


    This exception is thrown inside OGRE in Image::loadRawData(), and is not
    caught by the existing try-catch block:

    {{{

    size_t size = calculateSize(numMipMaps, numFaces, uWidth, uHeight, uDepth,
    eFormat);

    if (size != stream->size())

    {
        OGRE_EXCEPT(Exception::ERR_INVALIDPARAMS, 
                    "Stream size does not match calculated image size", 
                    "Image::loadRawData");
    }

    }}}


    At this point, size is 18162711 as expected, but stream->size() returns
    18162712.


    Turns out that this difference is caused by the precision limits of the
    float data type used for width_ and height_ in MapDisplay. In fact,
    (float)2781 * (float)6531 returns the wrong result, whereas the same
    calculation with integers (or doubles) yields the correct result. The
    attached patch fixes this by making width_ and height_ unsigned integers.


    I also suggest adding catch-all blocks (with an appropriate error message)
    in callback methods such as MapDisplay::incomingMap(), because otherwise
    shutdowns caused by uncaught exceptions just look like clean shutdowns (I
    guess WX tears down the application gracefully if there's an exception in a
    thread).

    If i move my 'image' window, after a few moves ROS will crash with a
    BadWindow X error. 


    I'm running on Gentoo with an ATI video card.


    I also tried the different RTT modes, no help.

    The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.

    This probably reflects a bug in the program.

    The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
      (Details: serial 30991 error_code 3 request_code 15 minor_code 0)
      (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
       that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
       To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
       option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
       backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

    On some Linux systems, rviz will randomly either run successfully or crash
    each time it is started up.  If it gets past the startup phase, it continues
    to run fine indefinitely.  For an older version of the driver, the success
    rate was about 1 in 10 tries.  A newer version of the graphics driver
    increased the success rate to about 5 in 10.


    Running rviz (1.8.0 or later) with the '-sync' option increased the success
    rate to maybe 2 in 3.


    The ultimate cause is still unclear.  A possible workaround is to write a
    wrapper script for rviz which runs it repeatedly until it succeeds.


    This particular error looks like this:


    X Error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 9
      Extension:    136 (Uknown extension)
      Minor opcode: 3 (Unknown request)
      Resource id:  0x5600004
    Segmentation fault


    or like this:


    The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.

    This probably reflects a bug in the program.

    The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'.
      (Details: serial 22 error_code 9 request_code 136 minor_code 3)
      (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
       that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.

       option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
       backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

    This bug was previously reported within a different ticket:
    https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4830 but I want to track them
    separately, so I'm now opening this.

    When I open a once saved config file, not every setting is loaded. For some
    display elements, all information is lost. This is very very unpleasant, as
    setting everything up and adjusting colors etc. for over 20 display elements
    takes a lot of time.


    As an example, if I look at that my config file it contains this block:


    {{{

    inflated_obstacles.Alpha=0,5

    inflated_obstacles.ColorR=0,65098

    inflated_obstacles.ColorG=0,47451

    inflated_obstacles.ColorB=0,258824

    inflated_obstacles.Enabled=1

    inflated_obstacles.Topic=/move_base/global_costmap/inflated_obstacles

    }}}

    But in rviz all of that is defaulted, according to what I see in the file if
    I save again: 

    {{{

    inflated_obstacles.Alpha=1

    inflated_obstacles.ColorR=0.1

    inflated_obstacles.ColorG=1

    inflated_obstacles.ColorB=0

    inflated_obstacles.Enabled=0

    inflated_obstacles.Topic=

    }}}

    Is it possible that the floating point numbers are written and parsed
    strictly localized? I think I had a german installation I saved the config
    with (comma vs dot).


    For the topic localization makes no sense, but perhaps the whole display
    element is defaulted if at least one parameter is 'wrong'.

    Some text fields (such as 'Topic', 'Decay Time') look fine when you double
    click to edit the values manually.


    However, ones related to the color transformer clip improperly and block
    some of the text.  Some examples of these are under PointCloud2:

    'Color Transformer', 'Channel Name', 'Position Transformer'.


    I've attached a screenshot.

  title: 'rviz: Deleting a "camera" display causes a segfault'
  body: >-
    When deleting a camera display, it triggers a segfault. The stack trace
    indicates it's happening in OGRE during the rendering of a single
    frame...some resource is being accessed in a scene graph node. This could be
    a pluginlib/class_loader issue, but without more information there's no way
    to verify. I'm betting the node is using a resource it thinks is still
    around and wasn't cleaned up properly.

      If an issue is set to `untargeted`, this means that there is no plan to
      address currently and will not make progress unless someone claims it,
      sets a target version for it to be implemented in, and does the work of
      opening a pull request, getting it reviewed and tested and merged.

  body: "I'm attempting to play a bag file captured from `openni_tracker` (skeleton tracking using the kinect), with an additional (custom) frame meant to provide a global reference. The custom frame is produced using a static transform publisher started in the launch file. During playback, RViz crashes if the TF plugin is loaded. If I don't load the TF plugin, RViz is fine; other nodes I'm running that do transforms between `global` and other frames also seem happy.\r\n\r\nThe crash can be reproduced by launching the following (note that I left `gdb` in there):\r\n```\r\n<launch>\r\n  <param name=\"use_sim_time\" type=\"bool\" value=\"true\" />\r\n  <node pkg=\"tf\" type=\"static_transform_publisher\" name=\"depth_2_global\" args=\"3.0 0.25 0 0 0 0 /global /camera_link 100\"/>\r\n  <node pkg=\"rviz\" name=\"rviz\" type=\"rviz\" output=\"screen\" launch-prefix=\"gdb -ex run --args\" args=\"-d tf_debug.rviz\" />\r\n</launch>\r\n```\r\nthen playing a bag file that recorded the `/tf` topic produced by `openni_tracker`:\r\n```\r\nrosbag play --clock skeleton.bag\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure I got the static transform correct, which is why I was attempting to view the TF frames. Since I can't post the bag file and the `.rviz` file is a bit unwieldy, all three files (`gdb_rviz.launch`, `skeleton.bag.tar.gz`, and `tf_debug.rviz`) are available at: https://personal.traclabs.com/~jkramer3/.\r\n\r\nThe crash happens about 8 seconds in, with the following gdb backtrace:\r\n```\r\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\r\n0x0000000000000000 in ??

        Thanks for the added comment @OkkeHendriks, unfortunately your backtrace
        is also of a non-debug version of rviz, and so there are no line numbers
        to give us a hint, but it is most likely a cross thread race condition
        in this code path.

      If an issue is set to `untargeted`, this means that there is no plan to
      address currently and will not make progress unless someone claims it,
      sets a target version for it to be implemented in, and does the work of
      opening a pull request, getting it reviewed and tested and merged.

  body: "I'm playing back a bag with a occupancy_grid, pointclouds, and a tf system. If the fixed frame is set to a specific (which happens to be the root of the tf tree) rviz will crash the moment bag playback starts. If the fixed frame is set to any other frame in the bag the playback will work correctly. After the first set of messages are displayed you can set the fixed frame to any other frame and rviz is fine. It doesn't matter how far into the bag I start playback the same thing happens.

I really am not surprised, considering how this property_tree_ is handled. It is destroyed/recreated here and there, in function either called by periodic timer update, or by manually using the reset button and so on...\r\nAny particular reason for deleting and recreating this object all the time?\r\n\r\nOne quick testing hack \"resolves\" the issue. Commenting line 574 \r\n```cpp       \r\n // Delete the old tree property.\r\n// delete frame->tree_property_;\r\nframe->tree_property_ = NULL;\r\n\r\n// If the parent has a tree property, make a new tree property for this frame.\r\nif( parent->tree_property_ )\r\n{\r\n    frame->tree_property_ = new Property( QString::fromStdString( frame->name_ ), QVariant(), \"\", parent->tree_property_ );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this most likely creates a memory leak.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the problem originates from race conditions between threads deleting the tree_property_ while others are trying to use it, thus causing random bugs.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't really have the time to figure out how to solve this properly, it would be nice if someone more familiar with rviz could look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bug can be reproduced in several (not always crashing, but quite frequent with a fair amount of published tf):\r\n\r\n- Open rviz, load the tf plugin, then start playing a rosbag or publishing a fair amount of tfs.\r\nIt crashes about 80% of the time.\r\nIf you play the bag first, and then open rviz all seem fine.\r\n\r\n- Play around with the reset button\r\n"

    If you set the timeout to zero you would expect non-blocking I/O, but it
    doesn't.

      body: "> Time for me to go back to school... what's the difference between the two, other than another level of indirection?\r\n\r\nTo ignore the question for a moment, the reason it crashes (IIRC) is because there are two instances of the not-so-single singleton. The first cleans up normally, but the second tries to reference a global state (the semaphore, as I recall) that has already been destroyed.\r\n\r\nI'm actually not exactly sure why it happens (TBH it seems fishy that it does); something about the way the object was declared in the header resulted in instantiations in multiple TU's, which adding the indirection prevents (you probably wind up with multiple copies of the variable holding the *reference*, but the actual instance is properly bound to the correct, single TU, so you only get one, and therefore only one destruction). You'd have to consult an ABI expert for a more detailed answer."
